They told me about the great learning experiences they had and the hands on approach Protege Ventures adopt which enabled them to grow as a person. Personally, i am someone who is tech-savy and interested in the field of Venture Capital. I believe that VCs are noble in a way that they are at the forefront of instigating ground breaking changes for the world. This is done so by providing adequate fundings for startups in order to carry on their operations or research in order to bring their products/service to life.

I feel that a business model like Polybee will be increasingly relevant in the world. Through combining technology with farming, they are able to improve on the traditional methods of age old farming methods which used to be done manually and grow more from less.

Additionally, Polybee has successfully programmed its autonomous drones to pollinate strawberries, tomatoes and other indoor food crops with a more than 90 per cent success rate of bearing fruit.

Furthermore, Polybee provides a solution to a need.

Firstly ,I believe that Food delivery has a huge market that has potential to be profitable. Looking at grab food delivery services, we can see that there was a huge increase in the demand for such services such that the revenues for the year 2020 was at 1.6b with forecast to reach 4.5b by 2023. This seems to be further supported by the fact that the covid 19 pandemic is here to stay which will convince more consumers to use online delivery services. Food delivery from the F&B outlets are deemed as necessary as well in order to reach out to more customers as more of such outlets uses food delivery services to future proof their business and provide more ways for consumers to get their food.

Secondly, using robots to do food deliveries allows the company to scale it business much easier as the expansion process will be much simpler. By using robots to do deliveries the company can ensure delivery services 24/7 which might appeal to consumers who would like to order supper late in the night. Scaling up the deliveries order to fulfill would also be much easier as long as there is sufficient delivery robots available and the delivery route mapped out. Any potential expansion within the area would likely just require more robots and extension to the mapped out areas for delivery.

Lastly, such a business model has a network effect and therefore has a huge economic moat. With more data on hand and ability to keep costs down the company would be able to keep the barrier of entry high as the company is able to keep its processes much more cost efficent with economies of scale. This would reduce competition within this industry with grab being its main competitor. However as Grab food delivery services relies on food delivery riders it would not be able to keep its cost efficient compared to whizz mobility.

In conclusion, the existing demand, ability to automate its food deliveries and the huge barriers to entry and ability to tap of economies of scale makes it one out the top choice to invest in compared to the remaining choices.",4,5,"I would less likely to recommend Fritz.

Firstly Fritz in involved in the Fintech space where huge competition exist. Companies with huge pockets like Alibaba and Grab are fighting within this industry and is highly unlikely for Fritz to become competitive given what they are offering currently.

Secondly the market they are appealing to might be too niche to be profitable. Targeting freelancers and digital entrepreneurs might not generate sufficient revenue given that the market for these people might be too small for them to be profitable. Earnings of freelances and digital entrepeneurs might also be cyclical which means that revenues generated from these markets might not be consistent and therefore highly risky.

While space travel has been gaining traction with companies like virgin galactic and most notably spaceX(aims to send humans to mars by 2026) I don't see how space travel could reach mass market within this timeframe. In 1903 the first successful flight happened and mass market air travel only took off from the early 1960s. Exactly 57 years and that's me being very optimistic.

In reality due to the nature of space travel the mass market is going to take much longer due to the logistics and environment of space travel. Unlike air travel where logistics required although significant but much lesser compared to space travel, the cost and the legal/political framework required for mass market travel would make it unfeasible for mass market space travel to occur within this century. Which means that i would not be travelling to space within my lifetime.

",4,4,I am a technologist at heart with a keen interest in entrepreneurship. I also have a finance background and I’ve always planned to venture into VC. I’ve heard great things about Protege Ventures from friends and seniors and I know that this is a great first step for me into the world of VC.  ,3,3,"Personally, I might have a certain bias towards Whizz Mobility because this company was founded by my classmates and seniors in REP. We share the same makers lab and we do help each other out with problems.

Initially, Whizz started out as an autonomous scooter company addressing a rapidly growing market segment of last-mile transportation in Singapore, differentiating themselves with autonomous technology. However, with the government restrictions, they have since pivoted to autonomous food delivery. This just shows the versatility of their technology and the wide applications and possibilities.

One of the most important factors for investing in an early stage company like Whizz is also the founder and team. I work with these people and see their work regularly, and thus can attest to the level of drive, competency and savviness of the company. Publicity and distribution is also no problem for them, having landed Foodpanda as a customer and been in multiple national news channels.

Overall, amongst the listed companies, I believe with the recent impact of the pandemic, Whizz’s autonomous logistic delivery market has the greatest growth potential and since they are a technology company, their service is easily scalable and versatile.

Although other companies do address pressing and important issues, I believe Whizz has the greatest potential in terms of market size, growth, technology, and versatility. ",4,3,"Friz seems like the company with the highest level of competition in today’s context, especially with MAS issuing many new licenses for digital banks, inviting big players from overseas as well as local giants to quickly digitalise.

With the vast resources these giants have in terms of finances, data, skills and technology, they can easily take out the competition from firms like Friz. i feel that the current digital finance market in Singapore is too saturated at the moment, and thus Friz would be the company I would be least likely to recommend. ",3,3,"I have a great understanding of startups in the Singapore and South East Asia region, having real skin in the industry for 2 years and interacting with both founders and investors.

",5,5,"Travelling to space is very probable in my lifetime. UBS has an estimate that in 2030, the market for space travel will double. Space tourism will become a $23 billion industry. I believe within my lifetime, space travel market cap will increase by many multiples and hence become more accessible because of several factors.

First, the privatisation of many space travel companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic means that the technological advancements of space travel will sky rocket (pun intended). Companies will prioritise lowering costs of production and actual flights, in order to build a viable commercial consumer base. Flight tickets will definitely go down.

Second, travelling to space might not only be for inter-planetary exploration. In fact, ability to travel to space means that long distance flights can be much faster, as such, there’s is a wide appeal to many international travellers. New York to Shanghai could be done in minutes instead of half a day. This will no doubt disturb the existing $3 trillion airline industry and make financial sense. This might see prices of these space flights lower dramatically to compete with airline flights, possibly in the range of the lower thousands. As such, contrary to what many think, with this factor, commercial space travel can impact almost all social classes of people in the world, not just the ultra-rich.

Besides, many members of the upper echelons of society might still want space travel to actual space or different planets. Obviously the cost of such flights will be much more expensive than travelling between destinations on Earth. This just increases the market potential of space travel and incentivises companies to make such flights a possibility as soon as possible.

Hence, I believe I will definitely be able to go to space in my lifetime. The question is just what kind of space travel will I be embarking on - long distance between two points on Earth, or inter-planetary travel.

I feel that the future is very unpredictable and not having a systematic approach is key to valuating a company's financial health in the future. This approach may vary from industry to industry and it would be wise to adapt to different industrial sectors. For instance, Ark Investment valuated Tesla at $3k by 2025 by the monte carlo analysis, 1.5K in the case of a bear, and 4k in a bull's case. The monte carlo analysis was able to take into account of all the factors that may affect tesla business.

He was exceptionally relentless in creating the best product he could by infusing the tech SpaceX experimented with Tesla- explaining the cost-effectiveness and state-of-the-art electric vehicle Tesla is producing.

Warren Buffet- not because he is crowned the best value investor in this generation, for getting early on Apple or what not, but because of his ability to change and adapt in times of changing economic outlook. In the book The Intelligent Investor, he always called IPOs overvalued and not worth the money in pursuing, however, this contradicts his decision in investing in Snowflake a cloud computing company that recently IPO-ed because he was quick to realise that this was no longer an internet fad, but digitisation is the way going forward regardless of the pandemic (the pandemic merely accelerated the process)

Jeff Bezos- the ability to create a conglomerate that is constanly expanding is insance. Amazon, once an ecommerce business has not only expanded into cloud computing, they are even venturing into digital advertising to compete with Google- this was all due to his API mandate; forcing inter-department mingling and forcing all departments to expose and share their data and functionality- this essentially allowed Amazon's thinking around their AWS and flourish as a leading innovative company (they were even recently in the talks of dwelling in the hair salon service/products sector)",3,3,"Very likely, I would say 5-10years give or take. With the rapid commercialization space companies such as Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and SpaceX (many more), the idea of space flights and even colonizing Mars (Musk's vision) does not seem so far-fetched anymore. However, the cost of space flights will need to be cut down tremendously in terms of the fuel, materials to be built...etc. In terms of materials, SpaceX seems to be the leading contender of creating cost-effective materials, and this is true experimenting prototypes rather than outsourcing manufacturers. However, in terms of fuel, the cost of aviation oil seems to be on a bull run due to rising inflation fears- how long it may last, i'm not too sure, but I'm predicting that there will be point of time where the cost of building spaceships will outweigh these marginal costs. (as of today Jeff Bezos just announced he will take the first space flight by Blue Origins with his brother :D, so yes it is possible)",3,4,"Decent effort, love candidate's honesty, but he should probably read the questions a bit more clearly before answering...","The applicant does have background in the start-up scene and has put int efforts into answering the questions, but the answers don't stand out particularly.

The business model of Friz is also highly scalable with relatively low CAPEX. furthermore, such platform is likely to have high level of stickyness as users are unlikely to switch platforms hence increasing the life time value of each user and would allow Friz to offer better incentives to acquire users.

Lastly, I feel that Friz would have the highest chance among the 5 start ups to exit with the highest multiple after it scales to a decent size as it could easiest be fitted into the ecosystems of other fintech firms, especially companies like SEA money (Owned by SEA limited) or ANT Group which all have received their license of digital bank in Singapore.

On potential market size/growth prospects: Ease and Noah did not rank high as their business models were centered around marketing or re-packaging existing products, rather than creating new products, which would probably significantly reduce the potential for '100x' returns. Whizz is covered in the next question. Friz and Polybee by a back-of-the-envelope calculation would probably have market sizes of similar magnitude in Neobanking and Agriculture respectively and thus I compared the two startups on defensibility.

On defensibility: While the neobanking scene in Singapore has significant barriers to entry
 such as obtaining the relevant licenses, as well as other points of defensibility such as through securing partnerships, I believe that Polybee is has a much stronger foundation for its defensibility. Polybee not only provides the hardware for precision agriculture, it also provides the software. This has the potential to act as a closed eco-system where Polybee's users are locked in as they have to use Polybee's hardware to access its software and vice-versa.



",4,4,"Whizz Mobility. While they have a fully working product and a few strong partners such as foodpanda, I believe that there might be a fundamentally lacking in it's defensibility and reliance on partners.

Defensibility is lacking. If their product is successful, at the moment it is still largely hardware based which is relatively easily copied. Furthermore, nothing is stopping the food delivery giants from building it themselves once the market need is validated.

In addition, Whizz is extremely reliant on partnering with food delivery networks. This puts them in a vulnerable position, where a possibility of just a single partnership going sour could put the entire business on the line.

1. Vertical farming and food sufficiency are growing topics in Singapore. Not only do we face the limitation of land space, but the pandemic and panic-buyings observed at supermarkets have also served as an unwelcomed reminder of how susceptible Sg's food supply is to external threats. These events thus increased our recognition that we need to improve our self-sufficiency. Polybee provides a solution that would streamline and increase the efficiency of vertical farming -- a solution that Singapore is increasingly focusing on.

2. Secondly, with the threat of climate change, the problem of pollination becomes increasingly prominent.

I believe that the skills required in VC cannot be simply acquired through whatever we learn in school, neither can it be done through reading theories. PV allows their students to have hands on experiential learning through the student-run venture fund. And I believe that this is extremely helpful and beneficial to students who eventually join the program, since they will pick up skills that are actually relevant to the real working world. This will help the students be more relevant to the working world. Hence, I hope to be selected at the very end to be a part of something that will definitely help me gain hard skills and be relevant to the industry!",3,"4
","I would recommend investing in Ease Healthcare. I mainly considered the current situation, the target audience of the startup and its credentials.

Firstly, the world has become much more technologically advanced than before. This means that it is a totally viable option to make use of technology to innovate and change our healthcare industry. Keeping the current pandemic in mind, everything is going contactless now - payments, work and shopping. The synergy of the 2 elements would mean that the market for telehealth would be growing in the next few years, as we probably won't see the virus going away so soon. Thus, the business will most probably bring in a high return on investments.

Secondly, in a rather conservative society like Singapore, sexual health matters are considered hush-hush topics -- most Singaporeans are unable to discuss this issue without judgemental looks thrown at them. However, sexual health is an important component of health especially for women since the reproductive system is inside them. The conservative mindset combined with the lack of knowledge on sexual health, is detrimental to people who actually need help urgently as they may be afraid and uncomfortable to face such harsh reactions from people around them. They may choose not to seek treatment which would put them at a risk. Hence, it is definitely beneficial for a company to provide consultations and medication discreetly to patients to make their experience smoother and more enjoyable, compared to traditional methods of visiting the GP only to get judged.

Lastly, the business is certified by the Ministry of Health. Since it has the certification, it is thus deemed to be safe. This would mean that there is quite a low chance of the business being caught up in a lawsuit due to its practices.",3,"2
","I would be least likely to recommend Friz. I mainly considered the current market for online payments and the value it brings.

Firstly, the current market for online payments is quite saturated now. Banks are moving to digitalise many of their operations and there are many digital banks popping up around as well. Especially household names such as Grab-Singtel. This would give the digital banks much more credibility than a startup like Friz. Furthermore, there are also many companies with similar business models like Friz such as GET and Stripe. Thus, investing in Friz doesn't seem like there will be a high return on investment considering the other players in the market.

Furthermore, Friz does not seem to be as impactful as the other startups. The value it brings is quite minimal as it only helps to automate certain financial procedures -- the only difference between the company and traditional payment methods. The automation of providing invoices can be easily done through other methods, hence the business model does not seem very attractive. In comparison, other startups help to make pollination more efficient through automation (which helps to increase crop yield in the long run), make healthcare more accessible and ensures patients have pleasant experiences which they won't be able to get traditionally, and significantly reduce delivery personnel costs for businesses.",2,2,"Over summer, I picked up dashboarding skills in my internships!

Being a SWE and creating a new dashboard function from scratch or using a productivity tools to dashboard are two different domains.,"""How does your company create value to the society?"" I think that this is a very important question that must be asked. More often than not, businesses are very profit driven and may neglect the society and environment while doing so. That is definitely not the way which we want start ups to move towards, especially when the world is turning their attention towards the ESG components of business. Hence, although we definitely want a high return on investment, we must not forget that the startup should be a sustainable, green business that provides value for society!","B - Would have given an A ut the answer was too idealistic and seems to lack practicality. Yes being ESG-compliant is something to strive for but is not the end-all, catch-all.  ","B- Ok answer. I think creating value to society is very subjective here, since the individual is more about value-creation (ESG mentioned, etc). Sometimes, great companies are also heightened through solving a specific pain point (which isn't a huge value add to society, but it gets a specific job done) - Is this company considered 'lousy' then?","1. My mother! I think my mother is amazing as she is able to cope and juggle time between doing housework, going to work and spending time with me. I think that it is definitely not easy considering how her work has been piling up and the line between work and rest has been blurred with the current work from home situation. However, she will never compromise on the precious time spent with me, even there is a mountain of work waiting for her to finish.

2. My grandfather! He is someone whom I really look up to. When he was a child, he never had proper education since sending children to school wasn't really a priority in the past. However, despite his circumstances, he managed to pick up English by himself (and he is really fluent at it!). I do remember him reading the newspaper and watching news on CNA everyday. He has really inspired me to never stop learning.

3. A colleague of mine. She shared with me that she quit her job a few years ago, to take care of her parents who were sick. Due to their medical bills, her CPF and savings were thoroughly wiped out. After her parents passed on, she got injured and required surgery as she could not walk. Doctors told her that she most probably could not walk again but with her grit and perseverance in practicing walking at home, she is now able to walk again (albeit slowly, with a walking cane). I think that it is really admirable of her to overcome such adversities, as not everyone would be able to do the same in her shoes.

20,Clarence Ong,Nathaniel Ling,3,No,checked,I run a coaching academy.,NIL,1,1,"I feel working within VC is much more meaningful as opposed to investment banking for example. To me and maybe to some others, sometimes it feels like the world has progressed so much and everything worth doing has been done but I feel that there are still a lot of “secrets” to uncover, a lot of improvements to be made in society so there are still many great companies to be built or at their start-up stage. We could cure cancer, dementia or even invent faster ways to travel. And so, I think the job of VCs are really important and meaningful and I want to be part of it, working w ambitious and passionate people to find and back the start-ups. And personally, coaching most of my students from scratch and many have been with me since I started, I have learnt to empathise better. I have forged really close relationships w my students and parents and find myself to really enjoy seeing the progress of my students, so much that I am willing to coach over 20 hours a week while in uni, which seriously pushed me out of my comfort zone.

Working w passionate and hardworking people really brings out the better in me, it makes me want to give more and do better.

","I would recommend Friz.

The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the growth of the gig economy as remote work became the new norm and I think the gig economy is here to stay. With government-mandated lockdowns in place, many people turned to freelance jobs for extra cash or work.  Businesses are also seeking to hire more freelance talent to complete projects. We can see this trend in Fiverr and Upwork's growth during the pandemic and this trend would bode well for Friz that are serving this niche for the coming years.

The market for digital payments are competitive, we see companies like Square offering their cash up and targeting the unbanked, yet at the same time, traditional banks are coming into the picture. What I like about Fizz is that it is not trying to compete in this entire market, instead it is serving a small niche of a particular group in one place. Avoiding competition this way is a wise move. The reason is simple: it is easier to dominate a small market than a large. What's great about Fizz's targeting strategy is that their customers are all based in Singapore, concentrated together and served by few or no competitors. After doing my due diligence, I can't seem to find any other digital payment services in Singapore that are targeting this niche.

I think Friz will build a sticky ecosystem over time. I would expect once their customers use their platform, they will continue to do so as they manage their personal brand and finances around the entire system, which will increase the switching cost. Given their ever-increasing gig economy and their ecosystem, I would believe their rate of customer acquisition to exceed their churn rate. If that is true, Friz is primed for extremely rapid growth as long as they focus their efforts on improving those two metrics above.",3,"4
","I would not recommend Whizz.

This is how Whizz markets its food delivery robot:
1. Rain or shine, mud or pavement, our robot can handle it while you’re comfortably indoors.
2. The resulting boost in productivity means we can execute deliveries at a low cost.
3. We provide a one-stop robotics solution for your business—we handle the fleet and logistics so you don’t have to.

This is definitely exciting and I do see the value in it. In terms of achieving product market fit, I think they are still far away from it. It can't run on stairs, which I think it is something to consider. From the video, it looks slow and I am skeptical in regards to how long it takes for the food to arrive. It is also bulky and I am not sure how it is able to navigate its way through certain residential areas.

What do customers value most? I think this product cuts out the middlemen - delivery guy, which will allow it to price at a lower cost. So that would solve just one of the customers' problems. But most customers would want it fast. At this point, it is too risky to invest in this them as I think distributing food with a robot is fundamentally flawed.

This does not mean it is a failure. Friz is still in its really early stage and I expect many pivots, experiments and validated learning to be made.

",4,4,"Human Resource Management, Marketing, Video-editing.",B- What does HR mgmt even mean for us?... but Marketing and video-editing is good to haves.,B - General skillset,"I don't think there is a right or wrong answer to this. But personally, i feel a VC needs to ask whether the startup knows which one engine of growth that it is focused on and whether the right kind of metrics are used. What I learnt from the ""Lean Startup"" by Eric Ries, there are 3 main engine of growth; sticky, viral and paid. At any time, a company could invest its energy in finding new customers, improving overall quality or driving down costs, and the list goes on. If a start up does not even know their engine of growth, it would not know which give the metrics to prioritise, this usually leads to a substantial amount of time and resources being wasted.

For example, let's say the core product of a startup exhibits viral growth, the key to achieving sustainable growth for a startup is to first know their engine of growth. Knowing it allows the startup to know which actionable metric it should focus on to measure its growth. For.the viral engine, it can be quantified by the viral coefficient which measures how many new customers will use a product as a consequence of each new customers who signs up. A viral loop with a coefficient that is greater than one will grow exponentially. So companies that rely on the viral engine of growth must focus on increasing the viral coefficient more than anything else, because tiny changes in this number can cause dramatic changes in their future prospects.

Since each engine of growth can be defined quantitatively, each has a unique set of metrics that can be used to evaluate whether a startup is on the verge of achieving product/market fit. A startup with a viral coefficient of 0.9 is close to success.",A - Could tell the applicant thought through the answer. Made effort to explain and elaborate. Abit fluff but yeah. ,"B - Good elaboration, but I think more specific questions could be mentioned here (like this individual mentioned about metrics.

I am a definite optimist and so I do believe the future will be better than the present as long as people continue to plan and work towards the creation of new things to better the world.

For over a decade, the world has awaited the launch of commercial space tourism operations that actually fly folks into space. Just two weeks ago, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic space plane has recently conducted the first of three key test flights that should enable it to enter commercial service. The recent successful test flight was a major step toward the future of the company. Basically, it goes to shows that commercial space flights is possible in the near-future. The world's richest billionaires are now racing towards commercialising space flights. And just as I am writing this, news are reporting that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos will take the first Blue Origin flight into space. Over the next twelve months, I am confident that the science-fiction concept of space travel will turn into a reality. And by mid-2022, Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin should be regularly flying people into space every month.

I do not rate it a 100% as space flights are for the rich, tickets are priced at staggering amounts of at least $200,000 USD and I can't afford it now. If space companies like Virgin galactic has the potential to scale and successfully launch flights, price parity in the future could be achieved for the mainstream to experience space flights too.",3,4,Pretty typical application.

The pain point seems valid as a full on invidividual freelancer would think similar existing products are overkill (like Talenox for companies). In terms of target audience, I think there's a growing number of freelancers world wide due to a gradual shift away from 9-5 jobs. It's a completely digital service that can allow them to scale fast without much extra capital compared to robots-based startups which have more uncertainties. Lastly, the profile of the founders of Friz (PPRO/DBS ex-software engineer and ex-mastercard product manager/analyst) suggest that they have the ability to lead this startup both on technical and business development fronts.

2) They provide a solution that fits into the economic life of students.

Students do not have much excess income to spend on discretionary spending, so food spending will definitely be central to their economic life.

Furthermore, despite 16-24 year olds having a much lower earning power as compared to 25-34 year olds, they are a close second in terms of their food delivery usage frequency. (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1147958/singapore-ordering-food-from-food-delivery-apps-frequency-by-age-group/).

Quick wiki says: ""As of April 18, 2021, a total of 569 people from 41 countries have gone into space according to the FAI criterion (579 people have qualified when including the US Department of Defense classification)."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_space_travelers_by_name

if I'm very optimistic and I assume that the industry will see an exponential growth indefinitely, in the future, such that it will take half the amount of time (~ 60 years from 1960-2021) to get the same number of people (579) to space...

Plotting this graph: f(x) = \sum^{x}_{i=1}( (\frac{1}{2})^i \times 60)

It starts to asymptote at about 60 years from now, with close to infinite growth of new travellers to space. So if I live for at least another 60 years, in the most optimistic scenario,, perhaps I might be one of them. Except that I'll probably be too weak to fly to space by then... So I'll still say it's low probability for it to happen, in the next 59 years.

My role was a Strategy and Network Development intern - where I was in charge of researching, testing and implementing new business ideas for the firm, and also to support our client's (PE firms, Sovereign Wealth Funds, Strategy Consultant etc) due diligence process by providing them with our network of subject matter experts for insights on emerging SEA industries.

I was also handpicked by the CEO and Co-Founders to be the Executive Assistant of the company, where I worked with them closely in a business development scope to communicate with external stakeholders, scheduling meetings with potential investors, clients and partners. The CEO, Benjamin, was previously the Business Development Head for GrabPay - and he directly helped to launch the product. His story is incredibly inspiring and hope to see more such highly motivated entrepreneurs in the future.

The other Co-Founder that I also worked very closely with, Wen Ge, was previously a Senior Associate at WaveMaker Partners.

",5,5,"I want to make dreams become a reality for entrepreneurs. Having interned at a startup, I recognise the importance of investors in the startup eco-system. Small businesses are the bedrock of Singapore's economy and I want to play an integral role in growing ideas to tackle new challenges emerging in societies. By channeling funds into the next generation ideas, I wish to grow relevant business solutions, for the future of Singapore. Prior to being a key decision maker in startups, I would definitely need a solid foundation of learning and an extensive network of highly driven individuals. I believe Protégé is the right place to begin this journey. ",5,5,"Ease Healthcare.

Based on my personal due diligence of the company (both from the internet and word of mouth), here are the two reasons why Protégé should highly consider to invest in Ease Healthcare.

1. Highly passionate and motivated Management Team - The two Co-Founders of the company are experienced in building businesses, and are very passionate in capitalising on a digital healthcare platform to help improve the sexual/reproductive health of people. Rio Hoe, the co-founder, is law trained who previously co-founded a media platform aimed at raising awareness of socio-political issues in Singapore. The co-founder of the previous start up I interned at, mentioned to me that Rio is an 'experienced person and can be trusted, and he is also a friend of mine'. Guadalupe, the other co-founder, had prior experience in the business development of a food-tech company. She also has trainings in Anthropology and sexuality studies which is allows her examine and tackle the sexual healthcare behaviours of Ease's users. Hence, I believe these two founders form a great team to carefully use investor's funds in order to continue to grow Ease Healthcare.

2. Untapped Female Sexual Digital Healthcare in Singapore - According to a McKinsey market research report, digital healthcare represented a global market of approximately US$350 billion, and tele-consultation, pharmaceutical care delivery is expected to grow at least 10 percent annually through 2024. In Singapore, more than S$342 million in the first half for 2020 of funding in Health tech start ups were raised. Moreover, there already exists a strong public-private collaboration between public health agencies and private companies, as well as a strong eco-system for digital healthcare start ups to grow. I believe that Ease Healthcare is strategically positioned to capture the Digital Sexual Healthcare market in Singapore - specifically, the female sexual digital healthcare of Singapore. There exists only one major competitor, Ferne Health. (And Noah, which focuses more on the male sexual health). This leaves a large untapped market for female sexual digital healthcare for Ease. I believe that investing in Ease Healthcare means that investors can tap on the market for sensitive medical advice, which drives demand for Ease's online products as people are generally less inclined to go to a public pharmacy/doctor to seek sexual advice. In October last year, the company reported that it currently has over 5,800 members on its platform and is growing at 15 per cent rate each week, mostly organically. Hence, I highly recommend Protégé to consider investing in Ease Healthcare. ",5,4,"Friz.

Based on my personal due diligence of the company, here are two reasons on why Protégé should not invest in Friz.

1. Huge number of incumbents - Friz would be competing with a large amount of, big current players already in the personal digital financial market of freelancers. Players include large Neobanks such as Lili, Lance, Lunar, Holvi, Aspire, Revolut, and so on. Not to mention already huge players such as Grab and ToGo planning to disrupt the digital banking ecosystem. This puts Friz at a disadvantage in terms of economics of scale as it would have to compete with such large incumbents with excess amount of capital. Therefore, I do not recommend Protégé to invest in Friz.

2. Too narrow of a product scope - Friz only has a single product of a 'digital banking credit system' that helps freelancers visualise, track and record their financial transactions easily. This forces Friz to only target a specific audience, which are only freelancers. Meanwhile, if Freelancers are attracted to a better pricing models or loyalty programs from other cash-rich incumbents, Friz would lose out entirely. Therefore, relying on a single product and audience would be risky and this is why is do not recommend an investment in Friz.

Benjamin Lee - Co-Founder of venture-backed firm Sealed Network. He is one of the most self-driven individuals I have ever met. His ability to consistently produce results day in and day out, inspires me to adopt a determined attitude in life. Having him as my boss during my internship has taught me the habit of waking up early and going to bed late, and taking advantage of every pocket of time to grow the company. He has a 'do or die' mentality, where he believes he must produce results for investors and the company. Of course, he also cares for his employees and puts in effort to build a healthy, highly motivated team at Sealed Network. I am very lucky to have him as my mentor and he is no doubt an unstoppable force of nature.

2. William Tao-E Lim - CEO of listed company Old Chang Kee. Why is a boss that sells curry puffs a motivation to me? He has taught me 2 big lessons - 1. Humility and 2. Identifying market trends. 1. I first met Mr William on the golf course at Seletar Country Club, a golf club where I practice at during my time in the Singapore National Men's Golf Team. He is a down to earth, super friendly and humorous person. Mr William and I go to the same gym at the club, and he shares a lot on the value of being humble - which has brought him success in life and at Old Chang Kee. He cares dearly for his elder employees, even spending time to chat with his cashiers to listen to their feedback. By putting aside his ego, he is able to communicate truthfully with his team and gather honest feedback in order to grow Old Chang Kee well. 2. Mr William tells me often to keep a lookout for opportunities, growing market trends and being able to take advantage of them. One example is him bringing in the idea of diversifying Old Chang Kee's products into a variety of different fried food, to capture the demand of the younger generation that do not particularly find curry puffs tasty. He also shares his musings on the growing demand for healthcare in Singapore and tells me to really look into healthcare for opportunities. Hence, Mr William is an unstoppable force of nature to me as he teaches me how to succeed in life by being humble and to be in tune with current market trends.

3. My mother - She has taught me the importance of presenting your best self always. My mom is a Social Worker - her job consists of listening to the problems of other families and developing solutions to tackle their problems. Her day to day job can include parents throwing their frustration to social workers, parents crying and seeking a listening ear from social workers. But my mom always come back home with a smile on her face, and speaks to us with love and respect. She does the same to her clients too on the job. My mom, despite sounding very typical, is the most unstoppable force of nature to me as she taught me the value of discipling my emotions, in order to approach each challenge with a calm and clear mind.

This is because 1) Friz is a fintech company that aims to extend credit lines in a fuss free manner for freelancer and gig workers within 24hours with flexible EMI payback options. Although, this may seem like a noble business idea that ties the two group of individuals over tough periods, the credit worthiness and unconventional credit checks on the individuals could serve as a double edge sword to Friz. For example, when the economy is hit by a negative systemic event (COVID-19), the number of gig workers and freelancers will be hit the worst due to lockdowns imposed leading to a loss of jobs and disruptions in the global supply chain leading to increased cost for acquiring inventory. This could result in an increase of default rates for Friz to book and answer to investors. 2) The B2B/ B2C business model that Friz employs faces huge competitors from traditional financial institutions and digital banks that have larger resources that also aim to serve freelancers and gig workers. This will force Friz to constantly watch the development and offerings of its bigger competitors to retain its market share. As such, Friz will find itself constantly competing by offering lower interest rates or by further relaxing credit assessment criteria and providing attractive incentives to use its card. This may secure market traction at its initial ramp up phase, but the accumulated risks gained will impact the viability of the business over the long run.",4,4,"Prior to my undergraduate study at SUSS, I graduated with a diploma in Architecture from Singapore Polytechnic, the 3 years provided me a fresh perspective and developed my critical thinking skills while improving the structuring of my thought process to communicate the idea across clearly and effectively.

Moreover, being proactive and resourceful, these skills allows me to lead and work closely with my teammates and achieve our desired end goals with minimal hiccups along the way. Over the course of my current internship with an EdTech start-up, I was fortunate enough to work directly under the founder that wore many hats, as such my responsibilities weren’t just limited to financials of the company. Therefore, being a proactive, analytical thinker and a great team player allowed me to synthesize information from various departments (Sales, Marketing, Financial, Administrative) to be a versatile employee. ",A: Can see that this person anticipates learning and growing. Current skills are also relevant to some degree,A: suitable skills and relevant anecdotes,"Venture capitalist is defined as investors that employ capital in startup companies that exhibits promising long-term growth prospects. These investments are often risky and illiquid, but capable of generating impressive return if invested in the right venture. Commonly, venture capitalist has the power to influence major decision of the companies they are investing in, since their money is at stake. Based on this notion, venture capitalist may be seen as profit driven entities that places the right bets on the right companies. But in reality this is far from the truth, venture capitalist can be viewed as guardians or even parents of the start-up company where they will guide and lead the start-ups in the right direction to achieve its potential and long-term success. Seeing the successful growth of the groomed portfolio company and its team reach their full potential is in itself the greatest satisfaction derived from the venture capitalist. This leads into the most important question VCs should ask startup companies: “How do you see the pieces of your team playing a role to achieve the vision of your company”. The nature of the question stems from the understanding of individuals comprising the team on an intimate level that works alongside the founder. This is a very important question as it showcases the level of understanding and thought given by the founder in constructing his “dream” team to achieve the vision of the company. Moreover, VCs will want to know the relevant domain experience, capability, motivation, and manpower available to realize the vision of the company. This will allow the VCs to connect on an interpersonal level and understand the strengths and weakness of each member of the team and find ways to make the entire team click. Lastly, the VCs will have to determine if the team will be enjoyable to work with and are they open minded to constructive criticism and feedback. ",A: good explanation on team first approach,"A: good rationale, gave a compelling argument which rings true","Defining someone as an unstoppable force of nature is viewing the individual to have a strong personality or character – like a tsunami or typhoon (natural phenomena), where they are filled with full of energy, unstoppable, unchallengeable, and unforgettable. With the aforementioned attributes in mind, the 3 individuals in my network that can be identified as an unstoppable force of nature will be 1) Father 2) Uncle 3) My Boss of CognaLearn (EdTech startup in Singapore). First, my father is an individual of habit and routine where he goes about his day filled with energy and discipline as he crosses out the goals he made for that day e.g. Groceries Shopping, Cleaning, Making Dinner. He is an inborn engineer at heart, where he prioritizes logic over emotions in many cases. However, this has been the cause of many disputes among hostile strangers and my mother. Looking past his short comings, he is a great father that never fails to ensure shelter and food is provided for. In my years growing up he has been a significant inspiration and person that I looked up to in being a discipline and responsible person. Second, my uncle has always been the additional pillar of support in my younger days for my mother and my family. We could call him the unsung hero of my mother’s family, where I could always count on him in helping and putting the interest of others first and taking care of the extended family. He was also a figure of importance that I look up towards, being able to shoulder the responsibilities of being the only son in a large family while also juggling his own family and career was what I admired most. Notably, in all situations he would always carry himself with full of energy while maintaining approachable personality that never wavers in the sight of adversity. Lastly, my boss / founder of CognaLearn Pte Ltd is a high achiever early in his career where he was an ex investment banker and management consultant at Credit Suisse and AT Kearney before being a CFO at SkyWest airlines. CognaLearn was conceived at a basketball game at NUS, where my boss was sold on the idea of being an entrepreneur in residence of Duke-NUS medical school. Thereafter, he persisted through highs and lows with grit and adversity where he had to lead and push a small team to develop the product and commercial aspect of the growing company. Being the founder of a product from university spin out, he had to pitch to investors, education communities and conferences to increase publicity awareness. I would never find him in a dull or frowning moment. He constantly complemented our employees for a small achievement and kept moral high throughout the toughest times (COVID-19 Lockdown). He is an outstanding individual, boss and mentor that embodies the characteristics of an unstoppable force of nature that I am truly honored to work with.",4,5,"Long standing crewed flights to space had often been monopolized by government agencies, namely NASA and Russia’s Roscosmos along with other international partners. But these agencies are now moving towards providing democratized space travel and opening up the skies to commercial opportunities that paves the way for private space tourism industry. The extremely exclusive club of space travel which was once only giving to chosen decorated individuals are now made available for individuals with deep pockets. As such, the probability of me travelling into space increased drastically from 0% to 25% in a single day since the announcement of the news. The increase in % can be attributed to the lifetime value and earning power that I am able to achieve by 45 years old in paying for space travel with a high-end estimate of USD $55 million due to the decreasing cost of travel to space overtime. In 2021, private company Axiom  space established its first all-commercial astronaut crew comprising of 3 paying customers where each forked out $55 million for a trip to space. Additionally, in May 2020, Space X made history as the first private company to bring humans to space. This a tremendous technological achievement for private companies, showing that they do not only have the desire but also the ability to send people into space via a vehicle built and owned not by any government. With the vision of affordable space settlement coupled with the decreasing costs for launch and space hardware in general, private big tech and aeronautical companies have begun leveraging satellite technology and access to space to drive innovation and efficiency for its new service or product suite offering to the mass market. With multiple entrants (Boeing, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic) moving into a true space-for-space economy aiming to put people in space sustainably and at scale. The 25% probability of me travelling to space is greatly reaffirmed due to the expected healthy competition among private companies which will drive prices to equilibrium levels for mass space travel / settlement. To increase the probability and certainty of me travelling to space, would rely on the ability of me to generate alphas in the financial market and be wise with my investments and career decision.

Problem: The traditional method of pollination is time-consuming and highly dependent on manual labour. As such, farming activities are being carried out mainly in countries where labour is cheap. However, this leads to a strained food supply in the long term and the  problem may be further exacerbated by issues such as: unstable food supply due to volatility in the global environment (pandemic outbreak) and a rapidly growing population.

Therefore, there is a pressing need for improvement to traditional farming methods in order to reduce our over dependence on specific countries for food. Also, recent trends point to an increasing demand for high quality food.

Solution: Polybee’s technology allows drones to pollinate crops with precision, even when farming conditions are unconventional, thereby leading to the most efficient and effective cultivation of crops.
Furthermore, its Phenotyping technology is able to conduct scans and use algorithms to reconfigure for the cultivation of super crops.

Analysis: The global smart agriculture market is estimated to grow to USD 22B by 2025, at a CAGR of 9.8%, showing that there is market growth potential.
We also consider external factors such as: 1) Research showing that autonomous drones for precision pollination in indoor farming can bolster urban farming and support nation’s goal of producing 30% of food needs by 2030 - in alignment with Polybee’s goal to provide pollination as a service in future 2) Singapore government's intent to set aside S$300M under the Startup SG Equity scheme, to provide equity investments to deep tech startups with strong IP and global market potential.

Given the global outlook, as well as support from the government, Protege Ventures therefore have strong reason to believe the potential for the market is huge.
",4,4,"Friz. It is a developer of credit line platform designed to bridge working capital gaps for gig workers and freelancers.

Problem: Freelancers and gig workers' difficulty in obtaining loans from banks.

Solution: Offers easy application of credit lines within 24 hours with flexible EMI payback options, enabling gig workers and freelancers to have access to tailored credit lines anytime at fair interest rates.

Analysis:
1. Unpredictable profitability - Gig workers (e.g food delivery riders) and freelancers tend to come and go, and the pool of clients cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, with the government's push for upskilling, gig workers with newly acquired skills may leave for better and more stable opportunities.

2. Weak credit assessment. Unlike banks, Friz does not adopt traditional ways of determining its clients' credit worthiness. Potential problems may be higher default rates, which in turn affects Friz's business solvency.

3. Friz does not seem to have an IP that will enable itself to stand out among the steep competition of digital banks and FIs. This would be of concern in a market where there are new startup entrants, as it may not be able to protect its market share.

Given the above reasons, Friz would not be ideal to invest in. ",4,4,"1. Critical thinking and logical reasoning
In my current internship, my company's existing method of manual data aggregation led to inaccuracies and inefficiencies in the business process. To resolve the issue, I was able to utilise automated workflows to streamline this process, based on my 1) thorough understanding of interactions between datasets and; 2) ability to filter and extract relevant data. Thereafter, synthesising these sets of information eventually allowed me to achieve the goal of setting up a logical process for efficient data collection. This amounted to about half the existing amount of time spent on data collection.

2. Technical and organisational skills
I was able to churn out meaningful competitor analysis within a short stipulated time frame. This was done through collecting and handling a variety of information (organisation background information, statistics and financial data) from various sources, such as databases and financial reports, to formulate informed points of view to assist in investor pitches.",A: ,A: could be good for special projects?,"""How did you put together your team, and how would you describe your team dynamics?""
This would be important in getting to know the company on a deeper level, financials and product aside. This may help VCs gain insight into how passionate and convicted the team is about this idea.

1. My elder sister: She is a decisive individual with a strong personality. For instance, while her peers shunned away from opportunities to relocate for their careers, she dared to take the leap and throw herself into an unfamiliar environment and through this experience, she was able to grow herself by overcoming the hardships faced throughout the period.

2. My friend: He is an opinionated individual who is certain about his beliefs and not afraid to express his ideas, even if they differ from what others think. Because of how he is unafraid to speak his mind, I am always blown away by the amount of thought put into his answers and it prompts me to see things from his perspective and think things as critically as he does. Because of this trait, he is often able to come up with sound advice, which is valuable and critical in his interactions with people.

3. My boss: He is a thoughtful and optimistic leader who understands the importance of employee welfare and knows that the success of the company depends on the happiness of the team he is working with. He always comes to work with a positive mindset and tries to influence people around him in the same manner through his actions and disposition.
Even when the world collapses on him, he remains calm and collected, and believes he can work through anything that comes his way. Apart from the business side of things, he is the father of 4 kids, who cares dearly about his family. Seeing both sides of him made me realise that one does need to be out-of-this-world amazing in order to accomplish big things.

- 50% of me travelling to space since 1) I should not completely rule out the possibility of me getting rich and accumulating that amount of wealth in future, and 2) assuming that a day would come when space travel is deemed necessary for survival (due to an invasion by foreign species or a lack of resources to sustain our lives).

Previously ive had previous startup experiences doing my own startup as well as internship at Augmentus.",4,4,"There are two main reasons why i would want to join Protégé Ventures.

Firstly, as a startup cofounder, Protégé Ventures provides me with perspective of Venture Capitalist as well as network with other VC's. This allows me to understand the fund raising process better and improve my startup's process of raising funds.

Secondly, it is my personal dream to be a Angel Investor after I retire. With the exposure to startup ecosystem and founders, it allows me to work together with founders
",5,4,"The startup that i am least likely to recommend to Protégé Ventures would be Friz.

The 3 reasons are 1. Team 2. Market Validation  3. Ability to raise funds

Firstly, both of the founders are full time with complementary skillsets with one being the Ex Mastercard executive. This would mean that there is strong domain knowledge about the problem and exisiting competitors. On the other hand, the other co-founder has had software engineering experience in a bank and is likely to able to develop the expertise/team to build the software. A team that uniquely understands the problem and has the skills to quickly execute on the problem can find themselves being early to the trend/market and building an competitive advantage that limits future competition.

Secondly, they seem to have a unique value proposition of providing loans to freelancers based on their work histories, and being an online bank of sorts. They have narrowed down on their target audience onto freelancers, built a product and are already having paying users. They are currently expanding and getting traction which serves as market validation.

In addition, they have received funding and support from various organisation validating their business proposition and potential. The most notable one being part of the YC which has one of the strongest alumni network having produced companies like stripe. Friz can effectively tap on the YC network for support and user testing/acquisition which could allow them to execute fast as well as get better business deals with partner companies.

However we do have to note that while digital payments and digital banks are on an online trend, the market is competitive with tech giants and banks and startups all trying to get a piece of the pie.

Lastly, the technology incorporated is not as complicated compared to the other startups we have on the least. This could be a double edged sword as it allows the company to scale with less talents, however their solution would be replicable and more prone to competition. However because the fintech space is built on trust and economies of scale, this would serve as strong defensive moat for the startup. Therefore as the startup gains user and serves well on their promises and prioritise trust and security in their technology, it could be a differentiating factor against other startups trying to enter the market.

In comparison to the rest of the startups, ",4,3,"The startup that i am least likely to recommend to Protégé Ventures would be Whizz Mobility. The 3 reasons are 1. Team 2. Market Validation  3. Tech

Firstly, their team consists of part time student entrepreneurs. While that could be a benefit depending on their domain as it allows access to mentor network and student testors, however this is a deeptech startup where they aim to be outdoor delivery robot. Therefore there has to be either a full time commitment from the founders or having experts on the team. However it seems like the team does not have the technical expertise to embark on a fully autonomous self driving delivery robot.

Secondly, while this idea is novel, it does not have a strong value proposition. Currently food delivery utilizes people to deliver the food. This startup aims to remove people from the equation. This is essentially trying to create a new market, but Whizz are unsure of their target audience and this greatly limits their ability to position their product and marketing for the right market.

They do not seem to have a business model to generate cashflow and even though they seem to be targeting a B2B model. They still have a big assumption that businesses would use them over simpler solutions like using manpower. That may not be the case due to higher cost of maintanance and learning the software for business

Lastly, the technical feasibility of the product could be limited. From my personal contacts with someone working in Whizz, they are not a autonomous delivery robot. therefore it still requires a driver in the form of an app.
The fact that they are trying to create a fully autonomous self driving delivery robot would require much more time and expertise. This is a challenge especially when the value proposition is unclear and unvalidated.

In addition, Whizz might be an overengineered solution, Scaling and maintainence could be an issue when deploying it.

Overall, they are a early stage startup that has some unique value, but without developing a business model or finding their target market/audience, they are still in the midst of finding themselves and should not be trying to scale with venture funds and hence are not ready for funding from Protégé Ventures.",5,4,"Software Engineering (Mobile development, full stack web development), Data analytics (Excel/SQL)",A,B: Great skillsets in tech,"""What makes your team uniquely suited to solve this problem?. The team is the most important asset of any startup.

Here are 3 simple reasons why:

Unfair advantage
A team that uniquely understands the problem and has the skills to quickly execute on the problem can find themselves being early to the trend/market and building an competitive advantage that limits future competition.

Dealing with failure
A great team would be able to reposition themselves and pivot if they do not find product market fit. For example slack started out

Hiring and Scaling
A great team would attract great talent. In the era of exponential technology, people is the most valuable leverage that would create maximum impact.

Disclaimer: Evaluating businesses based on publicly available info is difficult and horrible ideas can turn out to be very economical when applied. Therefore, my criteria is the business model which I can identify as having the least assumptions that a VC might have to resolve.

1. Institutional support for the company and the industry. In the Singapore startup scene (due to a small domestic market), institutional support can be a major stepping stone to expansion. Having worked with the Agrifood and Veterinary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment in policy-related discussions, I know that Singapore is aggressively investing in local food production for the next decade. Seeing as notable institutional partners such as the SFA and Temasek have shown support, this shows that Polybee is likely to have met very stringent standards and will likely at least receive some financial or regulatory backing to expand in a key policy focus.

2. Polybee's stated focus on collecting data shows me that the company is able to diagnose and quantify key areas of improvement, which is crucial for scaling a startup and overcoming barriers to growth. While the company may not know all the answers, its quantitative, data-driven shows that it knows what questions to ask. This is a determining factor for startup success in the long run. Therefore, with quantitative methodology and strong institutional backing, Polybee gives me relatively little concern at a glance.

Friz is operating in a very saturated market with very innovative and well-founded competitors (Brex, Square, Stripe), therefore it's hard for me to assume that they will out-execute all these competitors. Noah and Ease seem to serve a well-defined and potentially quite profitable niche. The only question I would have for them is how they would compete with other merchants from simply undercutting them. From publicly available data, I don't know enough about the market to understand whether their approach provides a significant competitive edge, and therefore I can't recommend them in confidence.",5,5,"Whizz Mobility

1. Tough market. The food delivery market is extremely competitive and saturated, with multiple large, relatively similar companies trying to undercut each other. Following Peter Thiel's advice of avoiding competition, this market is by far the hardest one to disrupt.

2. Potential gaps. While the idea of a delivery robot saves costs and is more efficient in theory, in practice this increases the number and complexity of problems which need to be solved vs the existing solution of a human operator. Deliverymen can adapt to difficult customers, take common sense shortcuts and fulfil small requests by conversing with the customer. A robot doing this would be much harder to automate, leading to backlogs on the scale of hundreds of orders. In addition, simply scaling the project beyond a university campus would require the ability to navigate roads, which in itself is a major industry issue.In other words, Whizz's business model poses far more questions than solutions in order to be viable.",5,4,"Online platform development: I was also previously Head of Ventures for SGExams, SG's largest online student forum w 300k monthly visitors, intiating projects w/ private businesses and the Ministry of Education and securing over 30k SGD in funding for a student-led education reform initiative.

Secondly, Friz is not an asset heavy company. Being a non-asset heavy company allows them to focus on upgrading their technology. To add on, they are able to pivot quicker if needed to.
Thirdly, Friz has a long run way and is specially built for freelances/entrepreneurs.

The first thought that came to mind was the target audience and the business model. Ease Healthcare aims to ease the access to sensitive health services and allowing women to take control of their sexual health and wellness.
Despite Singapore trying to be more open about sexual education, there still exists social stigma and barriers to sexual and reproductive healthcare access in Singapore. This is especially prevalent for younger females, where it is generally frowned upon to visit healthcare institutions for sexual healthcare services and the shame that comes with it from strangers, healthcare workers, and especially your own family, deters many from accessing these sensitive health services.
I would recommend to invest in Ease Healthcare as:
1) It provides a solution which has potentially a high acceptance rate due to the social stigma that deters many from using services at healthcare institutions, and it goes further with its branding to empower and educate women in aspects of their sexual health.
2) The social stigma that comes with accessing sexual health services is not likely to go away as it requires a long term shift in mindset and acceptance from the entire population. This means that the solution will not be easily replaced by the bigger institutions as the problem stems from social stigma and bigger institutions will not be able to recapture lost market share in the sexual healthcare industry easily.",2,3,"I am least likely to recommend Friz.
The first thought that came to mind was the target audience and the business model. Friz aims to empower freelancers and digital entrepreneurs that fall through the cracks of the traditional banking system.
My first problem would be that the target audience itself is already quite niche, and I am skeptical about the expansion of this solution to other consumers, as the business model is essentially just a credit business which gives advanced payments to its users and profits off the fees involved such as the invoice financing fee and the invoice processing fee.

Next, Friz aims to provide banking services such as Instant Invoice Payment and a Credit Line for freelancers and digital entrepreneurs as:
1) These groups typically do not have healthy cashflows as they are usually paid after completion of their projects and other platforms may charge high Invoice Financing fees should they require instant invoice payments.
2) These groups are typically rejected by banks for credit loans due to their unstable monthly income or lack of conventional monthly payslips.
My second problem with this solution would be:
Should this solution take-off and become more popular, it can be easily adopted by other companies which already have a credit function inbuilt that takes on the risks on behalf of their client through early payments. These companies do not necessarily have to be banks as many companies such as Fintech companies do offer advanced credit lines with minimal background checks such as 'Buy Now, Pay Later' companies.
Traditional banks may also enter as competition by catering to the freelancers and digital entrepreneurs through different modes of credit evaluation or offering lower Invoice Financing fees which Friz may not be able to beat.
This can be seen from traditional banks offering their own 'Buy Now, Pay Later' solutions after this particular payment method became more popular.",4,4,"I am confident in my ability to breakdown a company's core business model and simplifying it for easier understanding.

If the solution seems feasible and possible to implement with potentially good acceptance rates by the target audience, the most important question would be whether this solution can be easily replaceable; either by low barriers of entry resulting in high competition or existing firms adapting, and implementing the same solution or improving on the solution, because this would ultimately determine whether this solution would be a unique solution that is able to thrive, capture and retain market share.","C: The earlier points are non-points, if a solution has a lot of competition, of course it is feasible.

He never did well in school - his grades were not good and he claims that he is not cut out for studying. He started his company after National Service, with the initial business of conducting terrarium workshops. From there, he realised that events management was a field he enjoyed and he started to expand his company towards conducting event services and his company is now a well-known name in event management services. In his words, ""you pay peanuts, you get monkeys"", he ensures that employees are paid sufficiently and that the workload is manageable by being on the ground alongside his employees while running the backend of the event. He is constantly working to improve himself and the company, making him an unstoppable force of nature who I believe will go far in the events industry.

The last individual is my previous manager in United Overseas Bank, Florence. She is a manager for the contact centre department in UOB tasked to handle inbound enquiries from clients. She never loses her cool, even when dealing with difficult clients and she is the sunshine of the team, constantly motivating us and making the effort to connect with us despite us only being contract staff. She strives to deliver the best customer experience and she never lets others (such as her colleagues) bring her down. She is well-liked and exudes positive vibes to the people around her. I believe that she will be an unstoppable force in terms of the corporate ladder climb and also life in general due to her optimism.",5,"5

","Friz.

In judging all 5 startups, they all show promising signs of teams with a clearly defined goal and a strong drive to achieve their aims. However, in consideration of the market growth rate between healthcare (Ease, Noah), autonomous vehicles/drones (Polybee, Whizz) and fintech (Friz), Friz definitely has the advantage in being in a market that has very high growth rates as long as they manage to push out a product into the space.

More importantly however, Friz has the added advantage of having a product that is significantly better than any of its competitors in the space. They have managed to identify a serious pain point felt by over 80 million freelancers across asia regarding the ease of invoices and payment terms when dealing with traditional banks. With their product's easy integrations into the lifestyle of most digital entrepreneurs and with the agility to adapt to the growing needs of the modern freelancer, they are able to undercut much larger banks to cater to this under-represented demographic. ",3,4,"Noah.

With Noah and Ease, they both share many similarities with regards to the reasons leading their co-founders to start their companies as well as the positive social change that their companies are hoping to provide to consumers.

However, they both have very little to set their product apart from other competitors in the market. Neither of their pair of co-founders are experts in sexual/reproductive healthcare, nor are they engineering/product-driven. Consequently, their telehealth products appear to be very similar to each other, only differing in gender specific services.

Furthermore, they both offer no real advantage over other telehealth options that are currently available, and they do not show very promising business scaling models as compared to the other 3 startups.

For those reasons, Noah and Ease are both equally unsuitable in my opinion as a good investment choice for Protege Ventures. If I have to pick a weakest out of the two, it would be Noah due to Ease having a potentially better growth rate as femtech addresses a rapidly growing market space worldwide and enjoys stronger support from both governmental bodies and NGOs.",5,5,"Software Engineering, Outreach, Operations","A: While there is no explanation, it is easy to extrapolate based on profile of useful skillsets that would / could be useful in SP / Partnerships (SWE for tech projects + Hall exp (which I think are very events and outreach driven) )",C: 0 explanation,"Why is your team best suited to solve the problem that you have identified?

From a VC's perspective, it is incredibly difficult to source out pre-seed to early stage startups that show great potential for success, simply for the reason that they are so early on in the startup life cycle that very few companies will even make it to product-market fit.

Since there is no set formula on how to identify the ""next big thing"", the next best solution would be to judge the company based on the strength of the team. A team with great chemistry and incredible talent will be able to persevere through seemingly insurmountable challenges and will often be able to find novel solutions in a very short span of time to fix a bug or issue that could bring down the company, even if the company is in a seemingly unprofitable market segment.

SpaceX's founding team would be an excellent example of such a team. Having moved to Los Angeles to poach some of the best engineers in the entire world, Elon Musk managed to assemble a team of industry experts that had key insights into the hardware behind the space shuttle and rocket propulsion technologies as well as the lessons learned from the failures of startups in the space sector before them. Despite having three failed launches under their belt and less than two months of runway left, their team was able to turnaround from their third failed launch in just 6 weeks and finally have a successful launch of their Falcon 1 rocket.

By asking potential startups on the strength of their own team, VCs are able to gain an insight into the trust shared between the co-founders and the mutual respect for their abilities to propel the company to success. Not all successful startups have to have superstar co-founders, but rarely does a startup succeed having less than competent people leading the way.","A: Very compelling answer, and very true, well elaborated","A: good and compelling, shows effort","1.

47,Wang Dong Yue,Gordon Ng,2,No,checked,nil,"I did my first internship at a start-up called Kopi Date.

","I would be lying if I said I was not partially influenced by the television show Shark Tank. It is evident to me that the show was made for entertainment purposes, and is not a true representation of how investing and venture capitalists works. However, what it had inspired in me was the fundamental passion of investing and nurturing companies of the future. I understand that the Marketing degree I am currently pursuing has little relation to Venture Capital, but I am certain the skills and knowledge gained will be useful in my pursuit of this career. Having chanced upon Protégé Ventures and the work surrounding this organisation, I view this a chance to have a foot in the door, to learn as much as I can, and prove to myself that I have the capabilities to enter this industry. With the small exposure of the Venture Capital process from my previous internship, I am certain that Protégé Ventures has the capabilities to further propel me into the understandings and workings of the regional start-up ecosystem, and thus providing me an opportunity to kickstart my career in this industry. ",2,2,"Friz is the startup that I am most likely to recommend. Friz is a fintech start-up based in Singapore that was founded in 2020 with the goal of revolutionizing traditional banking for freelancers in Southeast Asia. The company uses data insights to provide timely and economical financial solutions such as credit cards, personal loans, insurance, savings, and investments.

The first reason why Protégé Ventures should invest in Friz is due to the company’s position within the fast-expanding markets of Fintech and Gig economy in Asia. The Southeast Asia fintech market had an expected growth of about US$70 billion to US$100 billion in 2020. Moreover, declining cash utilisation and rising adoption of e-wallets has seen digital payments grew 3% from 2019 (US$600 Billion) to 2020 (US$620 Billion), and these figures were forecasted to cross $1 trillion by 2025. Furthermore, investor sentiment in the Fintech industry has continued to solidify, and in the first half of 2020 alone saw companies raised US$835 million, nearly twofold what was raised during the same period of 2019 at US$475 million. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a catalyst for continued digital adoption in the region, and has further given mobile banking and digital payments a boost.

Work-from-home agreements, on the other hand, have demonstrated to large enterprises and small firms that remote work can be productive when managed with the correct tools. This has resulted in a worldwide movement in favour of freelance jobs and an increase in the number of freelancers. As companies adopt more agile and flexible cost structures, they are rapidly recruiting more freelancers, thereby providing more individuals the ability to access jobs from around the world and turning to freelance as a long-term career choice. In 2018 alone, the gig economy within the Asia Pacific had brought in about USD$ 204 billion in revenue. That number is forecasted to grow by a 17 percent compound annual growth rate with a Gross Volume of US$ 455 billion by 2023. Based on these figures, Friz stands in the middle of 2 giant and expanding markets that are accelerating at an unprecedented pace. Being the first neobank that specifically targets freelancers, further investments in the company will allow them to expand to more regions, capture more market share, thereby ensuring a high likelihood of survivability and growth in the long run.

The second reason why Protégé Ventures should invest in Friz is because their product provides a solution to financial inequity amongst freelancers across Southeast Asia. Data from the World Bank highlights that the number of adults that have formal bank accounts in the Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam are at a mere 34%, 22% and 31% respectively. This is primarily due to a lack of sufficient finances for saving. That stems from these countries' low GDP per capita and the development of a strong gig economy, in which people working in these sectors do not have a stable income or proof of income. As a result, it poses substantial issues for digital lending because it reduces credibility and confidence due to the lack of proper documentation, overall hindering these people from receiving their “credit score”.

These are massive countries within the Southeast Asia region where the company’s product can provide a new solution in the markets that ensures long-term growth opportunities. Friz is able to leverage on their technologies like data analytics and easy credit lines to make gig work more financially inclusive for freelancers, who according to the International Labour Organization in 2019, estimates that on average the share of employment being generated by the gig economy was 75.2% for countries in Southeast Asia. Being the first neobank for freelancers in Southeast Asia gives Friz its unique selling proposition amongst their other Fintech competitors that do not offer such services, thus solidifying their position as a leader in this space.",5,5,"The start-up that I am least likely to recommend is Whizz Mobility. Founded in 2019, Whizz Mobility is Singapore’s first outdoor delivery robot that offers semi-autonomous and end-to-end services that ensures delivery of food and logistics.

The first reason why Protégé Ventures should not invest in Whizz Mobility is due to its inability to rival their competitors who already have mature systems in place. Breaking the company’s business model down to its core, Whizz Mobility simply provides last-mile food delivery. This food delivery ecosystem is already populated with large companies such as Grabfood and Deliveroo, with both companies reportedly owning about 60% of the food delivery market in Singapore in 2019. These companies already have competitive advantages over Whizz Mobility with regards to consumer data analytics, last-mile route optimization and cost efficiencies. Scalability also comes into question. As of February 2021, Whizz Mobility currently has 5 “foodbots” deployed during lunch and dinner depending on demand. As demand for food delivery continues to rise in Singapore, competitors can easily hire more manpower to support such demands, but for a company that relies on building robots to delivery its food, it is highly unlikely that Whizz Mobility can quickly scale up production of its “foodbots” while maintaining low costs of operations to keep up with its competitors. With established players growing, expanding and covering larger areas of Singapore more rapidly than ever, it will be difficult for the company to compete against them. Whizz Mobility’s main clienteles will likely still remain as only university students with little growth and adoption in the long-run.

The second reason why Protégé Ventures should not invest in Whizz Mobility is due to a lack of a strong product-market feed that will make a breakthrough in the consumer space. The “foodbots” deployed by Whizz Mobility do not solve the fundamental customer pain points regarding food delivery services – slow delivery and inconvenience. The current “foodbots” in place are only able to  maneuverer straight and curve paths, travelling along pre-mapped routes at a mere 5km/h, and primarily sticking to pavements. Should the “foodbots” be required to cross the road or in the event it gets stuck, it would take human supervisor to take over control. This service does not inherently change or improve the speed of food delivery services, and might even take a longer time for customers to receive their food due to the limitations of the “foodbots”. Inconvenience is also another important factor that does not necessarily get improved. Looking at the way these “foodbots” are designed and their usage, they are unable to climb stairs and take elevators. Food is not directly delivered to consumers doorsteps, adding a layer of hassle for consumers who stay above the ground level. As a result, Whizz Mobility does not guarantee an improved service from the current food delivery system, and is difficult to see more customers adopt their service.

","I think the most important question VCs should ask is "" As a founder, what are your plans to continue growing your company and make it the market leader in the next 5 to 10 years?"".

Why I feel this is the most important question is because investing in a start-up is in essence not only investing in the founder’s ideas and vision, but as well as his ability to plan and execute these ideas even when the company is only at its infancy stage. Entrepreneurship is a risky business, and it requires an individual who can weather the intense and taxing journey. A founder who is well prepared and has the ability to think long-term will be a testament to his/her capabilities to lead the company because they are confident that their products and/or services is one that will revolutionize their industry and will survive in the long-run.  ","A: Vision of founder is something that is commonly missed out but is probably the most important factor together with the team execution ability at PV's investment stage. Kudos for correct and decent explanation, though can be refined.",C: Not very convinced ,"The first individual in my network that I identify as an unstoppable force of nature is guy called Michael Sirca. I met Michael while having a glass of beer by myself at a bar and approached him to share a table as he was having a drink alone as well. As the conversation went on, I found out that he was a Managing Director of one of the world's largest advertising agency. Michael, even after hearing that I was just a Year 1 student, took the time to listen and offer career and life advice. This person of such a high status broke down the barrier between a budding student and a foreigner who has achieved extreme success is one I identify as a true and aspiring leader.

The second individual in my network is my brother. Having seen him be determined to enter the finance industry in his first year of university, he has slowly worked his way up through various internships and CCA's that has finally resulted in him landing an internship at a big bank. He has a deep wealth of knowledge on finance and investments, and is someone I can easily go to and rely on for deeper understandings on concepts and applications. This, coupled with his continual drive for success and ""never-satisfied"" attitude has is the reason why I identify him as an unstoppable force of nature.

The third individual in my network is my current Boss of the company that I am currently having my internship in. She started her company back in 2016, and has grown it into a profitable business within just 3 years.

",5,5,"The probability of me travelling into space sometime in my life is very low. I understand that large investments into technology in the past decade has made space travel more frequent.

Why I am confident of my answer is because I myself love to travel, and yet have not even travelled close to 99% of the world yet.

48,Wang Dong Yue,Gordon Ng,1,No,checked,CCA Clubs,"As of writing this, I have ~11 months of experience as a Founder's Office Intern in a high-growth ed-tech startup, Kinobi. Having been in the team since the founders officially left their full-time roles in Private Equity, Consulting, and Software Engineering, I have seen the company grow from 0 to over 40,000 users.

Working closely with all the founders, I am active in a majority of functions within the company (Strategy, Product, Operations, Sales, Business Development, Partnerships) and have planned, proposed and executed multiple strategies to grow regionally. I'd like to give 2 examples to this.

Firstly, I led the ideation and execution of a major Kinobi event in Singapore - partnering with over 25+ student clubs and bringing in 20 speakers across roles and industries (JP Morgan, SAP, Google, Ninjavan, Stashaway etc). I had to work on limited resources and spent $0 on marketing, yet attained over 700 viewers over the 2 day event and $4,500 worth of sponsorships from AWS and Intralinks.

I am also managing a primary Kinobi product, the Coach Marketplace. I ideated the strategy to enhance Coach engagement on the platform to grow visibility of coaches on the platform. This includes running coach research, creating mock-ups on how coach involvement can be enhanced, and then leading it's execution.

Apart from this, I continuously question my founders on how the funding process works, as well as how they would be distributing equity to their angel investors. As a whole, startups and VCs are powerful to me as I believe they can change the world!
",4,4,"As an incoming student into SMU, I find it amazing that I would be able to influence (at some level) big change in the world. As a student-led organisation, this means that every action I take, and every person I meet would have a significant impact on the business at-large. Personally, I take tons of ownership of whichever projects I work on and thoroughly believe that with a solid team, anything can be done. Looking through the alumnus and current members in Protege, their caliber is quite frankly admirable and I would love to learn from as well as work with them.

I also want to be able to learn directly from seniors who have experience rather than through a page on Google - and from there give back to my juniors in the future!

Looking through Protege's portfolio companies, they all are in the business of improving society-at-large - be it through mental health and careers or building communities around AI.  On a personal level, I know that my work has to change the world in one form or another. In the same way, joining Protege will help me enable founders and entrepreneurs to grow their own world-changing ideas.

",5,5,"I see Noah as a high-growth opportunity for Protege Ventures.

1) There are massive shifts towards telemedicine.
As a whole, the telehealth scene is expected to grow by 21.8% CAGR over the next 5 years, with an expected market size of ~$16 billion. A Gartner report shows that there was a 50% increase in telemedicine and teleconsultation visits in the US, encouraged by the lockdown experienced in many countries.

2) First mover advantage, especially in Singapore.
As we see the market grow and become more comfortable with telemedicine, where does Noah come in? In Singapore's market, a majority (if not all) of the players are General Practitioners (DA, WhiteCoat) and do not specialise in Men's health due to the stigma surrounding sexual health, hair loss etc. This gives Noah a first-mover advantage a space relatively untouched by telemedicine as they boast over 8,000 users as of Jan 2021 & about 250 positive reviews. This is bolstered by Noah's focus of being discreet and affordable - lowering the barrier to entry for any potential customer.

3) Long-term potential.
Having it's first-mover advantage, Noah would be able to capture a majority of the market in through a strong product-led team. After they have been established, they can move into different verticals through their tech-enabled platform. This includes verticals like mental health, pediatrics, geriatrics, and insurance. In the long term, this creates an eco-system between products - similar to how Grab first started as a transportation company then expanded into other verticals like delivery, fintech and more. This creates a high-value community for users to share on the challenges they face in their health, followed up with recommendations on which Noah/Zoey/etc product they can use.
",5,5,"I would not recommend Whizz to Protege Ventures.

1) Limited track record.
Whizz's website shows that they have been delivering primarily to students within NTU and a few rides with Foodpanda. Although a Foodpanda partnership was secured, there has been limited visibility on the reviews and overall user experience for customers receiving their deliveries. Taking an example from the US, Starship technologies launched a similar delivery service robot - but was faced with multiple issues with technology, government, and pricing. An example of this was the high cost faced my clients who used the service, as well as regulation being a main barrier. It is important though to consider that Singapore is running a 1-year trial in Punggol with 2 robots as delivery operators, it will be a long time before organisations like Whizz may be able to take a proper step into the market.

2) Shallow functionality, especially in Singapore.
Delivery robots may solve the need of perhaps replacing the occasional human delivery driver, however there are not many obvious paths that the company can take to continue to grow. Eg. they may expand into delivering groceries under Pandamart of Grabmart, but the company will still be tied to their main functionality of robots replacing humans. With the no. of robots being a limiting factor, a majority of their revenue will be tied to the 1) effectiveness of these robots. Taking an extremely local viewpoint, over 60% of Singaporeans live in high rise buildings (with the number increasing as BTO sales also take an increase) - this will prove a challenge considering that the robot's functionalities in using lifts are definitely not sufficient as of now. Hence, this would be an example where the technology would be limited especially when contextualised to Singapore.

Great ideas can only be brought to life and fruition if those leading the charge are capable.

Taking an example from my current company, Kinobi, the founders have deep experience in building communities (The Mentoring Circle, SMU, and Mendaki Mentoring), are familiar with the regional landscape (Regional Partnerships team in Shopee, hiring lead in Oliver Wyman), and have ties to many investors (ex-Private Equity).

There are several reasons as to why. Firstly, the Fintech market is on the rise and looks to be one of the most attractive options as to head into. Big companies like Grab, Gojek, Sea are all looking to diversify their services into the fintech sector by providing banking services with some of them recently obtaining digital banking licences from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Friz is already ahead of the curve with its product already out there. At this stage in Singapore, the market would be considered new and fresh with very little competitors. Friz has the opportunity to capture consumers to set itself as the standard for neobanking in Singapore. Friz even knows how to set itself apart with targeted marketing especially at freelancers. Secondly, the smartphone penetration rate in Singapore is very high and only looks to become higher as time goes on. As more people turn to become more digitally savvy, the relevance of neobanks will likely increase in the future as well which would signify a strong future ahead for Friz if they are well prepared. Friz understands the needs of its target audience well and plays onto these needs which is why I believe it is worth investing in them.",3,2,"I would be least likely recommend Polybee for Protege Ventures to invest in. Polybee plays on the aspect of indoor farming for its product. Firstly, while indoor farming is especially relevant in areas that lack the land and space for traditional farming such as Singapore, with the government even trying to push initiaitives to encourage indoor farming, very few vertical/ indoor farming companies actually operate profitably at this current point in time due to extremely high operating costs. The idea of indoor farming is appealing but its lack of success in profitability will in turn bottleneck and stifle Polybee's success. In the long run, success would likely be limited and the investment would not produce the returns one would expect. Secondly, while Polybee recognises indoor farming's flaw of pollination and serves to resolve it, indoor farming still faces a myriad of issues that include but are not limited to technology that has not been matured yet, new and insufficient infrastructure and high labour costs even if physical effort is no longer required for pollination.",4,3,"My skills include but are not limited to using Python and SQL for data analysis, strong analytical and research skills in the marketing aspect of businesses.

It seems to be quite impressive that the applicant took an interest in taking part in a Business Case Competition during the 1st year of university. The applicant was also able to be awarded the Honorable Mentions Award during the competition itself. This indicates a strong analytical mindset/skill and a good ability to engage in critical thinking in analyzing strategies. This is especially crucial in the VC space where analyzing founders and the strategies that they plan to adopt with their start-up and questioning them about it is paramount.  The project for analysing the impact of COVID-19 on Singapore’s tourism industry using python and SQL is part of the mod requirements/capstone project for a programming course offered at the Nanyang Business School that I did as well. Am just wondering if the applicants skills with Python/SQL for data analysis exceeds the basic level taught during the module itself.,"A:  Analytical skills are extremely relevant while data analytics skills may be relevant for future special projects. 

Analytical mindset is corroborated by the Honorable Mention Award that the applicant's team received at the World Asian Business Case Competition 2021. Linking to Question 1, we see that the applicant has continuously participated in similar competitions which requires such analytical skills.
 ","I think the most important question VCs should ask would be why would I need your startup/product? What does it offer to me that I don't already have or have access to. A startup has to be able to prove that it is different from its competitors, playing on the same ideas again and again only saturates the market and doesn't set itself apart. How can they truly be a success or breakout if they are just repeating what the market can already offer consumers? What would motivate these consumers to switch to them if products on the market are not any different already? Most successful startups play on simple ideas that are around but give it a twist of individuality and uniqueness to become successful so I believe the question we should ask would be why would I need your product and what do you have to offer?","3. The applicant brought up the point about differentiation of ones start-up with their competitors. I believe that this is an important question as differentiation from ones competitors is one of the key things a startup has to work on to illustrate their main value proposition to their users. As stated by the applicant him/herself, an idea needs to set itself apart and to motivate consumers to switch to them. However, I believe that most start-ups who are ready and interested to pitch would already have a good answer for that. Asking this question would also require the applicant to know quite extensively about competitors for the start-up he/she is evaluating and provide good questioning and examples to the founders in order to gain context and to really determine a well-thought out answer from one that is not. Hence, I believe that this might not necessarily be the most important question a VCs should ask although it is definitely one of the many questions that could be asked during a pitching session(and a very common one at that). Its so commonly asked that most of the time founders would have already been very prepared for this question and hence, require more knowledge(about the competitors, what they do etc.) and analysis from the part of the VCs to be able to determine if the answer from the founder is a good one or not.","A: Achieving product market fit and having a strong understanding of the competitor landscape is crucial.

The probability that I would be travelling into space sometime in my life would therefore be somewhat reasonable to consider.

Also seems to have a good awareness, research and analytical skills that could be shown throughout the application and which he/she used to tackle the questions within the application. In terms of interest and knowledge about the start-up/VC ecosystem I am not too sure as well since the applicant does not seem to have much experiences/knowledge with start-ups. However, I believe that Protege Ventures might be able to provide him/her with that which could be combined well with his/her analytical skills which could benefit Protege Ventures.",Clear effort and shows interest in the VC/Startup space.

Currently interning at Novaxi Venture Innovation Pte. Ltd. till August 2021.","I have been working in Novaxi Venture Innovation Pte. Ltd. since May 2021, and Novaxi is a venture studio who specialises in designing, iterating and launching innovative businesses that drive positive disruption. Currently, I have worked in areas related in Agriculture and Decentralised Finance in Southeast Asia, attempting to identify gaps and creative business ventures that could potentially disrupt the current practices.",5,5,"As a SMU student who is currently majoring in finance and operations, I aspire to develop a career in the Innovation and Venture Capital (VC) industry. The startup sector is extremely fast paced, agile and constantly evolving, and I would really like to be part of it.

Since Protege Ventures is a student run VC, I am interested in meeting like-minded students who have a strong passion about VC. Moreover, Protege offers many meaningful seminar sessions with industry professionals, which will allow me to gain deeper insights into the VC industry. With this, I hope to learn more about the VC industry and apply my newfound knowledge as an analyst with Protege Ventures.",5,5,"From the list, I would highly recommend Protégé Ventures to invest in Noah. According to the Population White Paper (2013), Singapore faces issues with an aging population where one in four people will be above 65 years old by 2030. This trend strongly implies that the market for men’s health will expand as time passes, as most men face problems surrounding Erectile Dysfunction (ED) and hair loss.

Currently, there are several clinics in Singapore besides Noah which offer men’s healthcare services, and these companies include International Medical Clinic, Dr Tan & Partners, Tanjong Pagar Medical Clinic, OneCare Medical and Atlas Pacific Medical. However, these clinics fail to break away from their traditional image and practices, offering mainly onsite healthcare services and treatment.

Noah on the other hand, offers telemedicine and completely discrete services, even going as far as to make transactions discrete. Noah respects their customers' needs and understands the pain of their patients, delivering a low cost, efficient and secure service. This level of comfort and ease increases the stickiness of Noah’s customers, making the business more defensible to other threats and entreants.

Noah’s founder, Sean Low, is highly experienced with dealing with sensitive topics as well. This can be seen from his previous experience working for an end-of-life tech start up, where death, mental well-being and other sensitive topics are part of their daily job scope. As such, I am confident that Sean is able to create an experience where it is thoughtful, respectful and appealing to patients.

With digitalisation as Noah’s core, I am confident that Noah is able to increase efficiency, defensibility and stand out amongst their competitors. This can be observed with Sean’s claims that Noah has a compounded monthly growth rate of over 50% (however, this must be verified), signaling that Noah could path the way of telemedicine. With a simple and professional web design, Noah is definitely a breath of fresh air in the dated medicine industry.

https://www.techinasia.com/singapore-startup-aims-reduce-stigma-mens-health-telemedicine",5,5,"With the recent COVID19 pandemic and increased globalisation, the informal sector has suffered great losses and has been shrinking rapidly. This is largely due to the perception that the formal economy provides better job security, pay and benefits than the informal economy. However, the informal economy serves as a powerful tool to empower individuals in achieving financial stability and freedom, with many budding digital entrepreneurs surfacing online on platforms such as Carousell.

Friz acts as a digital bank which hopes to relieve the financial stress of people involved in the digital informal economy, helping individuals with payment, credit and other areas. This could be crucial for these people, as they do not have the traditional creditworthiness compared to people working in the formal economy.

However, Friz's approach towards payments, invoices and credit could potentially be outdated in the near future. With the rise of Decentralised Finance (DeFi), the streaming of payments is now possible, and it carries the tremendous power of decentralisation along with it. With smart contracts and standardised invoicing formats, once the agreement between 2 parties is reached, the delivery of service and products can be directly tied to payments. Hence there will be guaranteed payments, eliminating the need to chase payments. Moreover, payments can be made realtime using stablecoins (such as DAI), reducing price risk and protecting the value of payments/underlying crypto assets in the contract.

With real time streaming of payments, there will be less of a need to take on credit lines as well, reducing debt related costs and transaction costs. Many remain doubtful of DeFi/blockchain technology, but I strongly believe that these new technologies will be a powerful force to disrupt the financial sector, just like how derivatives disrupted the financial sector in the 1990s. A real working example of a platform that allows the streaming of payments is Sablier.

Friz must continue to innovate and expand their target consumers for them to remain competitive and defensible to entrants. These features on their platform are not new and are common pain points, with many other competitors seeking to do the same. According to my own anecdotal experience with a friend of mine, freelancers tend to have multiple streams of income. This allows them to achieve financial stability, and with their reputation at stake, both contracting companies are very likely to make timely payments. Hence the key unique selling points of Friz (invoicing, payments and credit) may be a mismatch to freelancers in Singapore’s context.

A possible sector to expand in is with the hawker industry. The hawker industry is notorious for their lack of digitalisation, even with strong governmental efforts to incentivise digitalisation. Perhaps, Friz can look into the pain points or reasons of non-adoption, attempting to solve issues in other sectors of the informal economy (other than engaging purely in the digital realm). With the recent pandemic, a family of mine has closed his store, as he simply does not have the creditworthiness to raise debt and was forced to rely on his savings. As such, the Friz should not restrict themselves to the digital realm, and expand their business, increasing their network, stickiness and defensibility.

",5,5,"Innovation and DeFi/Blockchain:
Currently I am working with Novaxi Venture studio, and is researching disruptive innovations and their applications. The main goal of this internship is to deliver a proof of concept product with their core features developed, potentially starting a disruptive product in Indonesia.

I have been involved with topics surrounding Agriculture and Insurance, DeFi and Blockchain in Indonesia, with innovation as the core focus of my work. As I am working on the projects currently, I do not have permission to share more regarding the details of my work, but would love to share about it in a conversation in the near future.

Other skills I have include Finance and Operations, which are 2 of my majors in SMU.
In my previous workplace, Pricewaterhousecoopers (PwC), I have experience in audit. I worked closely with SMEs to understand the processes of SMEs and Statutory Boards in the audit of
government grants.
",4. Experiences so far are positive and related to the start-up space(Novaxi Venture studio) and that sounds rather interesting. Seems to have a strong interest and knowledge about Agriculture and DeFi/Blockchain which are knowledge in 2 very specific fields that we can potentially tap into if he were to join Protege Ventures. He also seems to have/will have experience in delivering and building a proof of concept product which can be a beneficial experience that can add further value to Protege Ventures in terms of insights into product management and building a product/concept from the scratch. Seems to be quite extensively focused on building disruptive products and disrupting industries as well which might not always be the ideal state.,A: Good experience in VC space. Experience in the agriculture/DeFi space could be extremely valuable especially if PV starts to expand and screen startups in the larger SEA region.,"The most important question VCs should ask themselves and the startup is whether the startup is disruptive or not. This is extremely important because for a startup to be successful, it should always aim to disrupt the traditional players in their respective sector, hoping to resolve a pain point or introduce an entirely new approach in the industry. While we have heard of the underdog narrative countless times with companies like Apple, Google or Carousell, it is important to note how they rethink their respective industries they are involved in, innovating and disrupting the incumbents.
","4. I believe that the applicants views and questions about disruption is a very interesting one to ask founders. How can your start-up actually disrupt and go against the incumbents in their respective chosen sector? How can we use techology to address the pain-points or introduce a new, more efficient way of doing things in a traditional industry? I find myself subscribing quite heavily to that school of thought in the past as well. The ideas that start-ups has to be disruptive to remain competitive and to have an edge over the incumbent. The question is whether start-ups should actually “always aim to disrupt the traditional players in their respective sector”? Is disruption always a must? How important is disruption for start-ups and can a start-up still grow without disrupting the incumbents entirely(and inviting uneccessary competition)? Are the examples about Apple, Google or Carousell just a result of survival bias? I guess this could actually be explored more.","B: reasonable explanation. I feel that the term 'disruptive' is overrated and could be ambiguous.  However, I think what the applicant is driving at is PMF and competition. If we were to ask a start-up this question, we might get an incomplete picture because some times, start-ups believe that they are 'disruptive' but they aren't in actuality. We see this when they show poor traction. Therefore, more drilling could be done. But overall, reasonable job.","Firstly, I feel that my current boss, co-founder of Novaxi, Nicholas, is an unstoppable force of nature. Nicholas is an interesting entrepreneur who is looking to disrupt any incumbent industry in Indonesia, and is enlisting the help of many innovative Singaporeans to help him create ideas to trial in Indonesia. He has created a work environment that is extremely suitable for innovation, very much alike to Valve Corporation. Nicholas empowers and trusts his employees to choose their own tasks and projects, supporting them in any way he can, giving complete freedom for employees to choose and develop their area of expertise. This unique approach towards work is completely different from any other companies I have experienced, and is very inspiring to me. The ownership of my work with Novaxi is a truly unique experience, and I am really enjoying my time working for him in Novaxi.

Moreover, Nicholas is extremely encouraging, creative and open in his work ethics. Every Friday morning, he would allow us, the employees, to share something unique or interesting, such as Shark Tank videos or interesting news. This can include even humorous topics which are completely unrelated to our work, lightening the work atmosphere and ending the week in a lighthearted note.

Another person that I feel is an unstoppable force is a friend of mine who was the ex-president of SMU’s FinTech club, Isaac. Isaac is an interesting and extremely knowledgeable person, who is a humble and extremely patient person. When I entered SMU as a year 1 student, I had very little knowledge and understanding of the FinTech landscape, and Isaac was extremely understanding towards my plight. In the time as the president of FinTech club, Isaac fervently worked to improve our club’s network with other schools, industry experts and companies. This brought many companies down to SMU to conduct seminars, giving us a unique learning experience.

Lastly, a person that I feel that is an unstoppable force is my father, who is an extremely talented and determined person. He started off his career as a carpenter/stone carver, then a chinese scroll-mounting expert. Knowing that he has a strong passion for music from a young age, my father took a daring leap to venture into the music teaching industry, teaching the chinese instrument Guzheng. My father has always been on the lookout for the trends in the music industry, and had observed that the guitar was extremely popular. At the age of 55, he picked up a guitar and self taught himself how to play the guitar. My father’s fervent pursuit of his interest, passion and learning spirit has inspired me to develop my learning skills.

With the recent pandemic, my father, who had never used technology in his life, managed to learn how to use IT tools, such as skype and zoom to continue teaching guzheng to his students. This extremely adaptive and learning spirit is demonstrated throughout his life, and is a force to reckon with.
",5,5,"Personally, I feel that the possibility of travelling into space sometime in my life is extremely possible for other people, but unfortunately, not for myself. To start off, the definition of space to me is 80 kilometers above sea level, and space travel refers to the mere entry of space, unlike science fiction where people leap from planet to planet, galaxy to galaxy.

Looking at the space projects in China, US and India, it has shown that space travel is extremely possible. In fact, it is a regular occurrence for many countries since the 1990s, where resupply missions to the international space station is a necessity. However, if we are referring to space tourism opened to the public, unfortunately it will take many decades to come to fruition.

This is because of the inherent risks related to space travel, and the extreme physical environments astronauts face while travelling in space. Currently, the lowest cost per kilogram for space travel is $2,720 per kilogram, and it is achieved by SpaceX. To go to space, one must account for the weight of the individual, and the weight of the supporting equipment to sustain a person in space. Adding up all the costs, it could potentially take 150kg to send a person to space (ballpark estimate, in fact I think the estimate is low as there is a lot of life sustaining equipment), totalling to a cost of $408k. If one is merely looking to cross the 62-mile-high Karman line, Virgin Galactic quotes a price of $250k per person. With technological advancements, hopefully the cost of space travel could be potentially brought down to a more affordable level. At the current pace, it is very likely that in a few decades time, space travel may be brought down to an affordable level, as many competing private companies and countries such as SpaceX, India and China, have been launching rockets at a fraction of the costs compared to NASA.

While I feel that it is entirely possible to travel to space in the future, some key considerations have to be taken in. Firstly, the environmental impacts of space travel are tremendous, and an entirely new approach to fuel and propelling technology must be implemented for it to be a sustainable business (environmentally and business wise).

Secondly, the human impacts on the space environment must be considered as well. Currently, there are many space debris and space junk revolving around us, and people decrease their footprint in space as well, especially if space travel is commercialised. Not considering our footprint in space can have disastrous consequences.

Lastly, I feel that physical ableness is also very important in space travel. Unfortunately, even at my current age of 24, I am 100% confident that I would suffer severe injuries if I am launched at escape velocity away from earth. Since escape velocity is a natural and unavoidable barrier (nobody can escape from physics), space travel in a few decades time would definitely be impossible if I treasure my physical well-being. As such, I feel that it might be possible for a niche group of participants, but not for myself unfortunately.

I believe that it would be unwise to bet on a winner in this space, and although both these businesses have their USP (catering specifically for men or women), I don't see sustainable growth in the future for these businesses based simply on the idea.

On top of that, I believe that sooner or later having a brick-and-mortar store is necessary for credibility's sake in the medical consulting profession, something which these two businesses don't have as an perk for now.

",I would like to apply what I've learnt from my valuation internship and textbook theories into the VC space and determine if I am suitable for the VC industry. ,1,1,"Based on what I have noticed from the past startups that Protégé Ventures invested in, a recurring theme is the focus on disruptive technology.

From the list of starups, both Polybee and Whizz Mobility offers the disruptive technology nature that Protégé Ventures prefers. The business models also show potential in scaling up.

For example, Polybee aims to increase the yield of crops by imitating natural pollinators. While the idea might sound absurd, the fact is that population in Singapore has been increasing over the years; resulting in an increase in demand for food. With the recent Covid-19 pandemic, Singapore has realized that they need to be less dependent on imported food supplies. As such, various initiative has been launched to support local farmers. However, due to land scarcity, local farmers are unable to take advantage of economies of scale to compete with imported produce. This presents an opportunity for Polybee as their artificial pollinators allows farmers to increase they yield by ensuring all crops are pollinated. The use of Polybee's artificial pollinators is not limited to land scare countries such as Singapore. For example, in countries that experience the four seasons, businesses can continue to produce crops even during the winter months by adopting a greenhouse setup and the usage of artificial pollinators.

Similarly to Polybee, Whizz Mobility also present potential for up-scaling. As we all know, the food delivery services has been booming in Singapore. The use of delivery robots offers various benefits and mitigate certain weakness seen in the human delivery setup.

Firstly, delivery robots are able to provide a more accurate estimated arrival timing as compared to deliveryman. This is due to the fact that robots are programmed to execute a predetermined delivery path that could take into account various elements such as traffic conditions, and wet weather delivery path. This not only provides a more accurate estimated delivery time but may also improve delivery timing.

Secondly, delivery robots mitigate the risk of food products being tempered. Have you ever wonder why your Macdonald's deliveries are always in a paper bag with the opening sealed off? It is not because they want the food to be kept warm but to prevent delivery drivers from taking a snack from your order. With delivery robots, such risk are eliminated resulting in cost savings for businesses which might be eventually passed on to consumers.

Lastly, cost savings. While the initiate investment into delivery robots by businesses might outweigh the cost of hiring a deliveryman, the long term cost of deliveryman is actually higher (taking into account complain handling cost, deliveryman refusing to deliver during wet weather conditions, etc).

The booming food delivery industry is not just experienced in Singapore but also in China. Various delivery platforms such as Meituan and Ele.me has sprout up due to the demand for such services. Overseas expansion is definitely possible. ",3,2,"Based on what I have noticed from the past startups that Protégé Ventures invested in, a recurring theme is the focus on disruptive technology. While all 5 startups adopts technology into their business model, not all of them are disruptive in nature.

For example, Friz's business model is relatively unique in a sense that there isn't much players in this area. However, it effectively just acts as an all-in-one bank account; merged with the capability to produce and send out payment documents.

Similarly for Ease Healthcare and Noah, both aims to provide digital healthcare services by emphasizing on convenience and discreet-ness.

","My father, my mother and one of my army officer.

When I was young, my father was declared a bankrupt due to a failed business venture. There was even instances where strangers come into our house to auction off the television. As a child, this impacted me quite a bit as it shows the harsh nature of society. However, my father did not give up on himself. Instead, he work his way out of bankruptcy and was still bold enough to try setting up a business again. This time, his handwork paid off and he is now an owner of a hawker stall.

With a target audience of female interested in their sexual health, Ease Healthcare does well in providing affordable and convenient services whilst maintaining the aspect of privacy.  The privacy aspect is crucial especially in Singapore given our conservative nature where family shun away from sexual health, and this allows Ease Healthcare to tap into an underappreciated market of female sexual health in Singapore. This growing market would be accessible for most retail consumers given it is a telemedicine service which has slowly picked up steam for its convenience and privacy. The novel concept of focusing on telehealth services on female sexual health would be a good fit and allows for a strong growth potential in an untapped market. Compared to a similar concept in Noah, which targets male health, Ease Healthcare edges Noah with its specialised focus on sexual health and build its base around it (adjusting its business to revolve around privacy for retail consumers). Noah, although having a diverse product line cannot have a strong base with multiple line in hair treatment, smoking cessation, weight loss which all have competitors in Singapore market (private and public).

Whizz Mobility concept of outdoor delivery robot in theory can cut costs for business and it's semi-autonomous nature allows for easy day to day operation management. However, it has really limited market due to the nature of autonomous technology now. Whizz Mobility is effective in a small, localized environment such as NTU where their movement can be hardcoded from food stores to selected location places. Its semi-autonomous nature allows it to avoid potential obstacles along the way. That being said, it would not be able to perform outside the real world setting whereby obstacles are more complex in nature such as high intensity traffic or unknown places that the object has not been tested in. This is a main reason why the delivery service Amazon has focused on aerial drone delivery instead. This concept is similarly in nature to self-driving cars (i.e. Tesla) which is difficult to implement for a delivery robot concept and has already received much resistance despite years of work.
While it has a major upside should this work be successful due to the large consumer base that require automated delivery, its limited feasibility in real world setting makes it difficult for it to succeed. Even if it were to focus only on small, localized environment such as university grounds or workplace, the high capital and way smaller market does not bode well for success.

",4,5,"I would most likely recommend Protégé Ventures to invest in Noah because …
1.	Noah’s mission-driven business model solves a critical problem in our healthcare sector – According to the Singapore Medical Journal,  51.3% of Singaporean men in their 30s have some form of Erectile Dysfunction (ED), yet only 30% are currently undergoing treatment. As health issues like ED are stigmatized, affected individuals avoid seeking treatment as visiting physical clinics can be an embarrassing experience. Moreover, treatment can be extremely costly with branded viagras costing around $100, Noah’s medication option is priced much lower at only $35 for a month’s supply and delivered within 4 hours. As such, I have confidence that Noah’s one-stop-shop business model provides a strong value proposition that prevents stigmatization and being an affordable alternative in the men’s sensitive healthcare industry.

2.	Noah has a massive market size with strong exit potential – According to Graphical Research, the APAC telemedicine market was estimated to be worth USD $4.9b in 2020 and is anticipated to grow to USD $16b by 2026, registering an impressive 21.8% CAGR. Considering that Noah sits within the telehome segment (~45% market share), its APAC market size would be valued at ~ USD $2.2b in 2020. Assuming a very conservative 1% penetration rate, Noah’s serviceable addressable market size is ~ USD $22m in 2020. This appears to be accurate with Noah hitting seven-figure annual run rate within 1 year of operations according to Glints. However, considering that telemedicine is a nascent market in APAC, I am confident that its market size would grow significantly especially with the COVID pandemic boosting greater awareness. Furthermore, Noah looks primed for a strong exit considering industry-leading men’s health telemedicine player like HIMS & HERS’s recent SPAC merger with Oaktree raising USD $1.6b.

3.	Noah’s product offerings and services present strong product/market fit – According to an interview conducted by VulcanPost in Nov 2020, Noah managed to amass 6000 users within 6 months. By Jan 2021, it has been reported by Peak Singapore that Noah has a user-base of over 8000 users. Considering that SG is a relatively mature market with consumers still requiring more education (Oliver Wyman survey), a user base growing at over 12% monthly demonstrates good potential for high adoption rates in Singapore. This is further supported by the SG government embracing telemedicine and Noah’s 250 positive customer reviews (high average rating of 4.8/5 on Noah’s website). Hence, I am confident that Noah’s services have strong product/market fit particularly as consumers in need of sensitive healthcare services become more aware of telemedicine.

4.	Noah’s business shows strong scalability potential for its product line and business – In a short span of time, Noah has been able to expand its product line from Sexual Health treatments to Hair & Skin treatments over a few months. While this is not indicative of future product expansions, its identified specialty areas have huge growth potential. In the hair vertical for instance, Noah could expand into dandruff or oily hair treatments, etc. Moreover, as a health-tech business that relies on its online platform, its services appear well-primed to enter regional markets like Malaysia in the future. According to the Malaysian Society for Hair Science, 50% of Malaysian men face hair loss by the age of 50. As such, Noah’s services are highly relevant and transferrable to other markets.

5.	Noah has an acceptable competitive landscape – While the general telemedicine industry is a fragmented market with companies of different sizes, Noah has the first mover advantage in the concentrated men’s sensitive health services space. Noah’s closest competitors are SIRE and &SONS who similarly provide telemedicine services catered to the Hair Loss & Sexual Health. However, Noah’s service offerings are arguably more efficient, comprehensive, and established. Unlike SIRE and &SONS who delivers the medication within 3 working days, Noah delivers it within 4 hours. Additionally, Noah has a more extensive product line covering men’s health that are similarly priced and has ~ 10X more customer reviews than its competitors. ",4,5,"I would least likely recommend Protégé Ventures to invest in Friz because …
1.	Friz solves a niche problem in SG market – According to Zaveri, Friz seeks to address the problem of freelancers/gig workers’ getting delayed payments and inability to get bank loans due to their lack of monthly payslips/invoices.  While this problem is indeed significant, Gig economy workers comprise 191k residents (~ 9% of our entire working population) in 2020, which has dropped from a high of 223k in 2017 [Ministry of Manpower] and has remained at a stable 8-10% of the working population for the past decade. Further considering that the bulk of gig economy workforce are taxi/private hire/vehicle drivers (92%) that have access to invoice payment software, Friz is left with a very small target market (e.g., digital entrepreneurs only form 5.9% of the gig economy workforce). Hence, I am not confident that Friz’s business model solves a large problem in the SG market.

2.	Friz has a relatively small total addressable market size – Assuming that the average monthly income of an entrepreneur is SGD $4k with a target market of 15k workers in Singapore, the total addressable market size of the SG gig worker neobank market would be ~ SGD $36m (assuming 5% transaction fee). Assuming a generous 20% penetration rate, Friz would have a serviceable addressable market size of SGD $7.2m / USD $5.4m. This would be a relatively small total addressable market size especially considering that the gig economy workforce size is unlikely to grow significantly as it has remained stable for the past decade.

3.	Unproven business model and product/market fit – According to Friz’s website, its main value proposition is that it is a quick invoice generator that handles client payments, through invoice payment (5% processing fee vs 7% at a traditional bank) and credit line services (2% processing fee). However, potential questions remain as to whether users will be confident in a third-party platform like Friz to handle their finances. Moreover, with Friz only displaying 5 positive reviews of their services and lack of visibility over its current user base, it still lacks a strong proof of concept and hence has not shown good product/market fit.

4.	Friz faces stiff competition especially if traditional banks choose to develop in this space – While Friz is a first mover by specifically targeting the gig economy industry, there are other more established neobanks in SG such as NIUM and Aspire. As a mature competitor, NIUM connects any-sized businesses to the world’s payment infrastructure through 1 API and has operations in over 10 countries. Similarly, Aspire allows SMEs to incorporate their business, open a business bank account, and apply for lines of credit all in one integrated app. Moreover, with traditional banks like DBS rolling out new financial solutions to support gig workers, Friz might be facing stiff competition in securing clients.

","A.  Seems to have diverse experience and knowledge that will contribute significant to PV's overall learning
","What is the problem your company is trying to solve & how do you intend to scale your business?

As the goal of VCs is to identify & invest in companies that can provide significant return on investment within the next 10 years, it is important that the company that the VC invests in has a sustainable business. Typically, unicorns like Uber or Bumble share the similar characteristic of addressing/solving an important problem (democratizing ride-hailing & matchmaking respectively). Hence, understanding whether the prospective company (can) solves a real issue in their business vertical is extremely significant especially at the proof-of-concept phase to identify whether there would be potential market acceptance and good exit prospects. As such, as this would be a long-term investment, I also believe that it would be critical to understand how the company intends to scale its business or product line to evaluate whether the company has a clear understanding of their path to profitability and ability to achieve high growth.

",5,5,"2021-2040 (My age range: 27-42): 0% probability
- Non-Availability: According to 2020 CNBC’s report on the space tourism industry, space travel by Virgin Galactic is predicted to begin in ~ 2023 while its competitors are slated to begin in later years (due to COVID delays). However, companies like Virgin Galactic have already sold ~ 600 tickets. Given that there are limited approved space vehicles available (~1 per company as of today) and the vehicles can only carry 2 passengers per time, it is unlikely that there would be sufficient capacity within the next 15years. Assuming that the 3 space travel companies have 4 vehicles that can carry 4 passengers every day, there will be ~300k flight tickets total. With UBS estimating the US target market (VHNW & above) to be ~ 4.4million, the demand far exceeds the ticket supply.
- Unaffordability: Assuming my average monthly income during this age range would be USD $7.5k (~ SGD $10k) with an annual 6-month bonus (~USD$45k), I will have ~ USD$125k annually after tax. Considering I must pay for necessities e.g. housing, let us assume that 30% of my income is saved (~USD$710k). According to CNBC, the cost of sub-orbital space travel would be ~ USD $250k while orbital tickets would cost me USD $20m. While I can afford the cheaper option, it is still unlikely as the ROI is low, whereas the expensive option is out of my budget.

2040-2058 (My age range: 42-60): 20% probability
- Affordable but not optimal: Virgin Galactic is targeting the sub-orbital tickets to cost around USD $30k by 2040. By extension, lets assume that the orbital tickets would similarly cost 12% of the initial price (~ USD $240k). While the orbital tickets are now within my budget, this still presents a significant amount of money to invest in at USD $480k for 2 tickets. Given the high opportunity cost, it is still unlikely that I would spend such a large amount on space travel alone as other considerations like purchasing private property or being financially sustainable during retirement become more important.
- Unlikely to be available: Assuming a generous estimate where space travel innovation has  increased the vehicles' capacity to 50 passengers and 15 vehicles per company in this timeframe, this still would only amount to ~ 14.8million tickets in total. Supply of space travel tickets would still be relatively scarce given that there are over 10million individuals in the US alone that can purchase these tickets.

>2058 (My age range: >60): 0% probability
- Poor Health Condition & High financial risks: With my retirement, I am confident that my health condition & lack of active income would bar me from space travel even if I wanted to. Moreover, the potential health risks associated with space travel would dissuade me from even considering space travel.

1. Long-term viability of business model
2. Total Addressable market
3. Potential for fast growth

Compared to the other four, I would say that Whizz has a larger total addressable market for the target demographics of spenders, because it is essentially a delivery service and creates tangible value for customers, which can include just about anyone in this case. We can't ignore the big elephant in the room called COVID19. Contactless deliveries have the great potential to experience high growth, and intuitively, demand for such services are likely to increase much. This complements the business model's viability in the long run. With a good demand, the business can thrive and even grow, expanding into various underserved markets. COVID19 will not go away anytime soon and even if it does, the new normal has already brought about trends of people preferring contactless deliveries. Demand will be here to stay. ",4,4,"I would least recommend Noah because of these reasons:

1. Total Addressable Market
2. Unlikeliness of expansion
3. Fierce competition

Noah is mainly targeting men. This means women are out of the question. The total addressable market is only about half of the world population. Even when it can grow, it cannot directly grow to target women since it is already branded as a men's mental health platform (Unless maybe, they expand into another arm, another subsidiary to target women and leverage on synergies with men's mental health services, or collaborate with applications such as Coffee Meets Bagel or OKCupid, online dating apps). Even compared to ease, women's health seem to be more in demand because of pro-feminism movements. More romantically, men can be assumed to spend more on their wives than on themselves, and the demand for female services can be traced to men too. However, this is not as true as for Noah. While the expansion of Noah is still possible, it would likely take a much longer time for it to do so as the demand might not be very great.  Also, it may not be the case that every man needs mental health interventions from an online platform. While I would not wish mental health issues on anyone, I would recognize that there are a limited number of men with mental health issues salient enough to use Noah.

Having been suffering from mental health problems before, I know that mental health platforms exist in great number because of the nature of demand; people sometimes need immediate service. Such platforms are relatively easy to set up and there is bound to be fierce competition in this area. Also, there are free mental health interventions such as religious counselling, school counselling and even workplace counselling. Competition in this area is likely tough and scalability may not be very fast. ",5,5,"Outreach, Programs and Operations.

I put heart in what I do. I have always found myself to be an action-taker. Being daring enough to speak in public and engage other people is something that I am. In my co-curricular pursuits, I have organized various events such as mind-sports tournaments, even in online manners. My national service background as a logistics assistant made me more interested in operational aspects of things because I generally enjoy seeing to things getting done and done right. When I combine these 3 main skills that I think I am competent in, I generally find that there is a lot of fruit of my labor.

I have had the honor of being recommended by Professor Geng to SMU IIE for the Protege Ventures programme, and I am grateful to him for that. I have learnt a lot from Prof Geng and found his classes one of the most engaging, intellectual and paradoxical (He uses plenty of paradoxes in his explanations). Prof Geng has shown himself to be a very knowledgeable man with intellectual drive and a heart for others, especially his students. He is quite likely a high-flyer with a promising career path as a researcher, having the rank of Associate Professor at a relatively young age. He teaches very well and even mentors a hideous number of PhD students at a time, on top of his own basic research work. When most faculty would mentor at most two PhD students at maximum, I know that Prof Geng currently mentors 6. He is also writing a book on Digital Business and is the area coordinator for the new ""Digital Business"" Major in SMU Lee Kong Chian School of Business.

One of my favorite professors, Professor Goh has been a highly influential figure in my life. I know what he does for a living; finance. Aside from his basic teaching loads and research, he manages JCube Capital, alongside other finance professors, as the chairman. He founded Citi-SMU Financial Literacy club, putting together a platform where students in SMU and beyond can learn about money management. While he is highly accomplished in his own right, he never fails to teach with his heart. I fell for his classes within five minutes and have always enjoyed lessons. Even as a very well-accomplished man, Prof Goh still provides the human touch for us, cracking jokes about life whenever and wherever, even during lessons, and these jokes made me understand finance a lot. Not a mathematically inclined person by nature, I miraculously grew to like finance because of Prof Goh. ",5,"

1. Polybee is very clear in its mission and vision. They have also accurately identified an issue that is commonplace in the age old industry of horticulture and are using novel means in order to address and solve them. I also believe that drones are an excellent way to solve these issues. Humans tend to be highly inaccurate when pollinating plants by hand as there is always margin of error in terms of timing and amount of material given to the plants for pollination. If humans seek to be more accurate, their speed would suffer as a consequence and that is not ideal in terms of farming, where speed is needed to cover large areas. Drones  are very accurate and with the data that drones draw from their cameras, they are able to use the right dosage at the right timing. Given that routes in green houses and indoor farms are fixed, drones can travel at high speed along pre-programmed routes and not collide with each other or humans, and scale heights to do their work efficiently and effectively, whilst collecting and storing valuable data that humans are not able to.

2. Also, this is something achievable within a reasonable timeframe and not a brand new technology that is not yet mainstream and needs to cross the 'chasm' in order to be adopted into the mainstream. The news and acceptance of drones is now rather normalized, and people are able to recognize the potential that drones can bring about in their businesses.
Furthermore, they have their own proprietary software Phenobee that adds greater value to the company as they are not leveraging off another company but building their in house specialized solution. This distinct advantage would make them very appealing to consumers looking to start and automate their greenhouses.",3: Point 1 is ok but point 2 isn’t very convincing. Could have added some hard numbers and evidence to back his/her answer up. Could have done comparable competitor analysis to support his/her point on how their in-house software is a distinct advantage for polybee.,5,"Whizz Mobility - For the same reasons I support Polybee, I do not think that Whizz has a long term future with the current model and path they are going right now. I understand that last mile delivery is a huge market that is still rather nascent, but in terms of food or parcel delivery, human riders are best able to make the right decisions faster and better than current robots in this space. Furthermore, they are also more agile than Whizz robots. [Reason 1] As an NTU student who stays at Tanjong Hall, where Whizz robots are mainly stationed at, I have frequently come into contact with them and I have seen many students almost fall over them as there is no warning when the robot goes by you, due to ambient sound obscuring the robot's sounds(motors) and low height of the robot. Cars have also almost hit it before. The robots still have to be monitored through cameras by end operators. [Reason 2] I believe that drones, being able to fly at eye level or higher, and being more mobile, would easily solve last mile delivery faster and more efficiently in due time than relying on Whizz. And I estimate that the timeframe till drone solve this issue is short enough that we are able to tide over such a period of time using human labour as we do today, without any need for investment into robots like Whizz's. This is given the software ability of DJI to automatically track people/objects and even avoid trees etc in mid flight very quickly and agile. Plus it is loud enough to warn people of its presence and


Noah - I felt compelled to add this as I have tried my hands at a healthcare startup previously. In this case I support Ease over Noah. Comparatively to Ease Healthcare, Noah is trying to solve too many issues at once and covering more ground than they can handle. Ease is more specific in grouping their services and specializing in Women's sexuality services, whereas Noah from their webpage, does not come across as anything special as they target acne, hair loss, mental health etc. There is lack of clarity and focus in their product offerings. Companies like Intellect focus on mental health only, Ease on female sexuality and Beijing101/Yunnan for hair loss. As a observer, I am unsure what they specialize in and would rather seek a company that I am sure specializes in my problems.",4: Good analytical thought-processes into Whizz’s product,5,"Marketing and Sales.

This is because I am believe the saying that a great idea with poor execution will lose out to a good idea with great execution. And execution is wholly dependent on the team behind the idea. If the team is well made and there is great chemistry and a common goal within the members, even if progress is slow, I am confident that they would attain success, and the only other factor being time. But, if everyone in the team is not familiar with each other and each person is there only for their own goals, then the team would quickly fall apart once they are pressured by external factors that pull members away from the projects as they are not fully committed and have other ideas in mind.",A: Good answer on the management team and he/she provided strong examples on how the team is a make or break for startups who have a great idea but are unable to execute that idea well enough.,A: Team is important,"Mr Richard Koh - My mentor. I am blessed that I was assigned randomly to be his mentee. Even though we could not meet physically as it was during the worse of COVID-19, we had monthly Zoom calls that were extremely helpful in helping me shape my thoughts, clarify my doubts and enlighten me on my ideas and paths that I was interested in. It was my first mentorship experience and I gained more than expected. This is because we were able to understand each other well, and he reciprocated and matched the level of effort that I put in. He too was an entrepreneur who's company had once ran out of money and they still ran without salary, and are one of the few companies that ever come back from the 'valley of death' when money ran out.

Mr Deeb - A successful entrepreneur I met in a physical talk I had signed up. Back then in Year1, hardly anyone signed up for the talk in school as it was exam period and everyone was mugging. I was one of 15 people that did. His story of being a poor university student who had to eat free bread as dinner from his friend's bakery, going bankrupt to rising back up and finally retiring as a multi-millionaire is totally inspiring and showed that there are others out there that go through more hardship than me, and yet succeed. If they can, I can too. I am privileged to be able to have his contact details.

Mr Roderick Chia - My professor. He is a part time professor who teaches some modules in school. He is someone that walks the talk and does not just teach theory. Whatever concepts he taught us about marketing, like Google Ads or Crowdfunding, he himself had spent money to play around with the technology and functions and derived his own conclusions before teaching us. He is able to show us how he crowdfunded his own project on Kickstarter, and give us insight on how to run Ad Campaigns.",5,5,"Exact probability I am not sure. But if given the chance, or if within my financial means, I would take it up instantly. Perhaps a probable figure would be 70%. I am fairly confident in my answer as we know from Mohr's law on projection of future trends that improvements are generally exponential and come faster than humans predict it to. The recent news of China's own space station and rapid growth in space flight gives me great hope that more competition will bring forth more innovation and speed up the process of making humans an interplanetary species in due course.",4,5,Quality responses and good effort in his/her answers,"Put in effort for his application, gave quality responses.

Thought process:
- I start with the ends in mind, asking 'will I want to buy this company's shares rather than those of the other companies in 5 years time'?
- I then adopt the Porter's Five Forces model to screen the desirability of the business's equity interest.
Reasons:
1. External: Demand for autonomous pollination is likely to increase due to: a) industrialisation of agriculture, as already existed in the US, which requires high degree of automation to cope with the larger scale of operation b)greenhouses and vertical farming will be more prevalent as a result of lack of land and the more frequent extreme weather (draught, flooding, etc. due to global warming).
2. Internal: The core of the business is the technology, which is a sustainable competitive advantage (as opposed to 'low price' which is hardly sustainable). The technology is the unique capability of the business, which creates a natural barriers to competition. This means there is chance for the company to obtain monopoly or oligopoly market position if the business manage to enter the market early enough. Such market position no doubt will attract future investors/buyers. ","3: answers are ok but he/she could have explained more on his/her analysis using the porter’s five forces. Only “Threat of new entrants” was covered. 

He/she could have also elaborated more on other factors such as their product/business roadmap and go-to-market strategy to support the analysis on how quickly they can enter/capture the market. While market opportunity was covered, the link to SEA could hv been better established.","5

Reasons:
1. External: Demand exists, however, so does similar service provider. As far as I am aware, in Singapore, Raffles Hospital is offering online consultation; medicine delivery service not yet, but this can be easily established, with grab delivery for example. In China, platforms offering online consultation are also abundant.
2. Internal: I do not see any unique resources or capability that will allow either business to build up a natural barriers to competition. This means the company will face fierce competition while the switch cost of customers are relatively low - they can go to any other similar platform.

Why: Out ultimate goal in VC is to be able to realize the investment we have made by selling the company (in private of in public). Hence the most important thing we should look at is the potential increase in the shareholder value of the candidate company. ",B+: Can’t refute this because that’s indeed the ultimate goal for VCs. But giving a B+ because the main way VCs make money is via management fees rather than carried interest. The latter takes wayyyyy to long to realise ==> At least 5-10 years.,B: Answer is ok,"Unfortunately, I could only identify one - a friend of mine from the school, who had a tragic childhood but managed to turn this into advantage by helping others; the person is very successful in his field by now.
